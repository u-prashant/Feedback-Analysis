Graphics not working properly Nexus 9 Game does not present itself properly. Field is entirely black. Players and uniforms are all blacked out
Used to work just fine.  Once my android phone was updated to 5.0 the app cannot copymove any file...  A fatal flaw since I paid for an app that doesnt do anything no more.
What happened Was the best ever. Now pop up ads on every page I go to. I have to search for the page I'm at all over again coz I can't go back. And one if the pop up ads links to this very page. You officially suck now.
This is point and click call of duty. Three released in one year and a fourth coming soon. ReallyReally Don't waste your cash,this game is complete crap
Had it as well for long time They really need to fix the lollipop issue.  Phones are moving forward not in reverse. I paid, so please fix for lollipop.
Reducing 5 to 2. The course I play Willowcreek is all screwed up. I tried to fix and seemed to help. Now its screwed up again. This is Willow Creek Sun City Arizona. I think somebody is  doing it wrong can it be locked when its fixed
Average at best The 500 music theme is used throughout the entire game, seems like a rushed job, no tension with the dramatic music like the real life game, however graphics look good.   Verdict Not worth paying for im afraid. 410 for me.
STUPID There is no direction to go UNDER STUFF
Pictures in Vault Older pictures can't be moved out. Error states You SD card is full. Back to vault now  But I clearly have space for it. I tried adding new picture into it and taking it out it works, just older photos won't work. Any quick fix
Good game still get ads. I paid for it why am I getting ads.
It thinks we are in Sydney....I'm in dunedin nz.....not very good
Needs to change a bit Not fun at all. Game takes money fast then give you too little to play anything after 3 hrs of waiting.
Still freezes Love the game itself but when i go to beat pops for the second time it freezes on the kill shot. I sent an email to the developers and recived nothing back. If this scam isn't fixed soon I'll have to find a way to get a refund.
Photos in the vault disappeared Updated the app now all the photos saved in photo vault have disappeared..... Kindly help me get back my photos
To many ads I get why this game has ads but this isn't what I thought would happen I can't even go to the level screen without it popping up ads If I take the ads off, it crashes and I have to start all over

Kent This app charged me twice for one product.  What's up with this
Doesn't work I bought and installed this app on my Huawei G6 but contactless function doesn't work at all.
App is dead, no updates The developers have stopped supporting this app. It's full of bugs that will never be fixed and is a rip off to those of us who paid for the app
Don't like I very very very very very hate this game
Piece of junk Do not buy if you have a note 4. Give me a refund
Shut the ads up OK, I understand the need for ads to pay for the game but there's no way to mute their juvenile music. That makes the game embarassing to play in a public place.
3rd class game. 3rd class game...
Awesome
Worth of money I can still use for anything i want FREE version. I've installed it because i wanted to restore one unsupported file but I didn't know i can use PC app.
Bad Just use a wired USB mic the app makes the game unplayable from the audio delay.
It takes to long to download
Doesnt allow exporting data Expected to save files and export since this is a paid version. What a disappointment Other apps can much more for a similar price. Also takes ages to get connected to the device.
Sucks Crashes like hell and won't let you post if does not feel like it  . Complete garbage

Still keeps crashing I know you guys updated the app twice within 23 days. I was promised a fix by the 4.12.4 update, but that didn't work. I'm now on the 4.12.5 version, but it still crashes on start up on my Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge.
Unfortunately, it has stopped unexpectedly... I loved this game N0w I can't play it and I updated like they asked and this is what I get
British centred questions I am buying in Ireland but all questions are Brit  centred. Also, when I saw this I wanted to return it and get refund but option was not visible.
Cannot use Insure app after update After last update app doesn't recognize me or allow me to refresh register.
Boring So it's boring basically
What does it do I do not want this social network, but it is practically impossible to eliminate it from Android.
Dumb You can just repeatedly press the same key and it plays the song,I'm gonna uninstall this app  gt
I don't even know though I mean, it COULD have been fun. But the ad at the bottom of the screen kinda covered my shootpunch button, probably something under the ad that could have helped me drive the car too, but I wouldnt install again
Crap Doesn't work... though gps mandatory on... half star
Its lacking Only thing that good about this app is that its Chica, but nothing really works well and its boring
Stole Money THIS GAME WILL STEAL YOUR MONEY. Decided to buy the Unlock Everything packet and it took my money and unlocked NOTHING.
GARBAGE Don't waste your time on this unplayable game. Every time I even open it, the user interface stacks up on itself, So I Cant Even See The Screen. Broken app won't go 3 seconds without glitching up
Canadian Holiday's Bus times do not reflect Canadian holidays. All the arrival and departure times are incorrect.

This is so not appropriete fir children in the volleyball one the guys privates are dangling out. My little 5 year old cousin was playing this and she asked me what that was. Try explaining that one to a 5 year old without traumatizing them.
Rubish app Used to luv it. Now it won't work on my note 4 . Can't load seating plan.
Very irritaing Ads cover the page and irrevlant
Exelent app This app can make safe driving and protect life

Doesn't work on androids Saw the magic on an iPhone. Bought a couple coloring books and tried with my Galaxy Note and nothing happens. Disappointed kids....especially after seeing it work on an iPhone.
Badd Very bad
The business is GREAT The app is horrible to be honest too long to try getting done at first...... moves very SHOW.... eventually I did it.... and the service was great....App still need more work in my pinion
Just constantly crashing Really enjoy the game when it works but just freezes up to often. Takes away from the enjoyment of the game. Using a Samsung Galaxy S5 lollipop update.
not convinced if this app requires android 4.3 an up, then why does it not work on android 4.4.4 devices When you call vitality drive, they say the device is not compatible, how is it not compatible I don't understand
Does not work on latest Android M preview I have been using this app since about 7 years, it seemed the purpose. But ever since i updated to Android M preview is not loading. Please fix it. You will get 5 stars.
page
Developer is begger Every 10 second  advertisement stop begging anyway uninstalling
Lack of features There is better gun apps out there.  There is no safety or manual  reloading.  Solid app but lacks the full steps of loading  a gun
Definitely shows it's roots... This is a port of an old Flash game, and it definitely shows in the graphics. Also, it gets very monotonous very quickly.
Ummmm... This dose not make sense.I mean like it's weird and it's a mimic of minecraft but wierder.Thats all I have to say...OOI wish I can rate it zero star's.
Garbage Don't waste your time downloading. Only part of the menu items even show up and is overall uneasy to use.
Delete Well its just black every time i try opening it and I had some good beats to it but seems like you guys don't bother fixing amything rate 1 this is just bad
Needs fixing My talking bubbles wont work when i click on them they wont work. Slow and needs to be improved.

I hate it so much I just want to scream
Keeps closing saying unfortunately maps has stopped working Can't do anything, always crashes
Angry parent It was fun but it stopped playing and some activities cannot be unlocked Do not download this crap
OK to start,  nothing more. Game seemed decent,  but after around level 14 or so it decided I can't play without registering an account. Was decent for 30 min, that's it
Bring back old cp I will wreck your offices and show you memories of old cp I loved it so much next day I woke up and it was all changed and again bring it back I will be sending you in to the past Disney Love it never gonna stop playing

Don't install it Very bad game don't install it
             
Data theft Check permissions before downloading. Why does it need to know what calls i make
No What is the the point of paying 2 pound when you can get real mine craft please let me save my work then I'll give you 5 stars
Was fun Seems like after update you win 1 out of 100 spins.... which isn't enough money.... and I refuse to pay real money for fake money.... still nice concept though
Fruit nothing I click on the game, it opens, I chose the game, and nothing. It opens but I can't move a thing. I tried sliding the fruit, clicking it and then clicking where it needs to go and it will not move. Is there a secret to it 
Unbearably laggy Inexcusable performance, lag makes entire game unplayable. Nvidia Shield tablet
Doesn't work Stock lollipop nexus 7 2013. Will not open at all, needs an update.
Adds galore Whatta shame. Looks like a good app. Shame that the pop ups wlways interrupt.
Hate it It was not unlocked next level and it was boring game
App going downhill Every call I make spawns multiple recordings on this app now. Sometimes it record sometimes it doesn't but a 30 minute phone call will have multiple Recordings most with nothing in them sucks now
Hybrid app and looks like it. Webview flickers. The touch isn't natural. Could do much much better.
Inaccurate 80 I know its not easy to predict the weather, but it changes every other min, and seems like yalls guess is as a good as mine.
It was so good before. I uninstalled before. Now that i reinstalled it I can't restore my purchase and there are no keyboard sounds when I tap the screen during songs. The game just turned dull and uninteresting now. Please fix these issues.
WHAT THE FK..... it's a very good and interesting game but.....only 6 free levels and then you have to pay rs 249 to play rest 19 levels.
Won't work Sound but no picture, realised too late for a refund
Love this game, but I recently got a new phone and even though I'm signed in it won't take me to the levels I was at before. Wtf

The graphics stink like turds yeah poop rules
The balls touching each other Hate it
Can't receive calls I can make calls.  I CANNOT receive calls.  Also, the number that is programmed on the app is a Malaysia phone number.  When I make a call, it's a Florida number.  Why, why does it have to be so difficult
Huge file, quick game The file size is way too large for a game so quick and simple. It its fun enough, but playing to 1M if practically pointless and 2M shouldn't be the most. Add 3 to 5 for at least another star.
It crashes all the time
No love it This game sucks
Bug Keeped flickering to a blank gray screen an will no longer mark either  x  or o . Froze
Crashes upon opening Please help Game looks so fun and i purchased it, but every time i try to open it, the game immediately crashes

Payment failed You should consider linking to Google Wallet
Don't get it It is the worst game that I have played it doesn't even let u play it properly. Like u start then it just gets u through the games level plus it has so much adds so u can't even see half of the letters so do NOT get it.seriously.

Ful
Hated it
Fails on the most basic task ... which is to display comics, because the screen keeps turning off while reading. Which makes the app mostly unusable unless you enjoy manually activating the screen every few seconds.
Bugfull Lot of bug exist in the game..also screen size is not aligned. Please update bug free virson...
I love it It it is so cool that I got 5698 as my score is that cool I think it is so get this game because it is so cool   who whoever don't get this game they are lame and if u play this game you arr so cool right in my opinion

Accelerometer problems Funish game with great graphics, but the accelerometer will flip mid game for no reason. Entirely frustrating and disappointing. Ruins the experience.

Sonic runs way too fast. I can't explore the upper parts of the level cause sonic is running so fast, I have no time to figure out a way up there. The game is a big blur
Good game but ... I wish you could make it so you can play online with other people for coins  and to have guidelines
Ad packed annoyance 1 long as before apple actually opens.  2 ads per level... Annoying. Uninstalled.
love it when it works The last couple months the server has been playing up a lot and there has been constant disconnections from games.  Extremely frustrating when u can't connect back to the same game. Fix connection crashes.

What's with your seating configuration It's not loading. Big inconvenience App sucks
The worst game I hated  they don't  even have good cars plus every single time I play it a car bumps into me . so you better  not install it
Stupid and disappointing Awful awful story. The actual puzzle solving is good but the end is just so disappointing, as I I can't believe that's it with many expletives thrown in.  Should have saved my money. Good app if it was free.
Nope Doesn't work on my tv and the app pops up with ads that you have to click just to get them off the screen. Not worth your time
Spider solitaire Cards are too hard to move

Very poor. Not good on Oppo N3 5.5 screen, glitches a lot. Graphics are poor.
Doesn't open Throws a marmalade error for opengllt and hangs on the Sims beginning screen. Wish I could get a refund.
Too unreliable Wasn't too bad to start with, but I've had enough of the tiles jumping around and leaving me having a forfeit when the timer runs out. Uninstalling it
Rip off Credit info is missing and outdated. My report didn't have account payment history for the last 4 months... how does that help Plus my contact details and employment history are 5 years out of date I want my money back
Almost perfect. I can't seem to find an option for left handed players. Bummer.
Not opening It doesn't work at all.all it does is open then closes
Won't load It was fine before the latest update but now won't load at all. I would really hate to delete the app because it was working so perfectly before.

Can't login Useless app, can't login even after resetting my password.
Favorite Love this free cell All others I tried have a clumsy interface. They also make it too hard to win. So glad I found this one.
Sweet girl Why do we need to pay money for the stores
Could be much better Not very much going on, games take too long and gets boring quickly.  Needs more strategy, troop types etc. Tutorial is rubbish.
Very poor indeed Downloaded this app thinking, great However there were three of us skiing the exact same runs and somehow managed completely different results even though we were almost copying each other on the runs. Unreliable and waste of money.
Wtf update D pad is wayyyyy too big why change it, square Enix has no idea what they're customers want
Randomly starts in the background Since the last update, I will hear random audio playing even when my device is in standby.  Came to find out when twitch is open in the background it will randomly start.  Scared me at first.
Nice concept but touchscreen fail on Galaxy note 2014 10.1 I liked the concept but this doesn't work properly the UI prevents me processing past the tutorial first steps due to buggy touchscreen on my galaxy note 10.1 2014 edition. Refunding.
Good app if your area is listed Seen a lot of cities on the list... which is cool, but I have issue with not being able to request areas andor be able to imput the codes yourself. I my own worse enemy by not checking things out before purchasing.
Its getting BORING Fifa 15 on Android has became something i cant even talk about ,whiles our companions in IOS get to play online and all those stuffs, we get an update to change balls in Simulation mode

There are no free hints..  Suggestion  the jackpot should pop up automatically for the hints coz i cannot find it to roll ...
Really slow feed update Devs, could you please answer why updating feed is such a slow process It takes around 1 minute and it's just no good. Running kitkat with ART.
rude this is wrong becuas show ing the pics with the jokes is bad A LOT OF PEOPLE COULD TAKE IT RONG AND FEEL BAD ABOUT THEMSELVES
Nothing New May as well delete them no new updates since it was made
This app is bull The only thing free about this app is the download.  You need to pay just to see who want to meet you.  Just be straight forward and charge in the beginning.  LIES ALL LIES
Bonus and scatters are very rare Uses all you credits at a fast rate with no bonus or scatter.
Hate it worst game ever it crashes if I get 1 wrong
Little rewards. It drags on...
Bad app Downloaded but pop up comes up and won't go off so I can't see the screen to play
I hate this game . You have to pay for the horse cleaning thing , and everything else . Don't get this game , but if you want to pay for it then do it .
Please fix or refund Nexus 6 won't launch
Worked fine up until the update The update messed up my game. I try to run it, but just went to a black screen. Nothing.shame on you rockstar....SHAME
Bummer Thank goodness for the refund button.  I do appreciate that feature
Controls The controls are way too hard
What the heck If I wanted an app that had a black screen when I opened it I would have turned off my phone. And that would have been free.
Don't install Very bad bad game.  Please remove from play store this game
it doesn't work at all don't use this app this is stupid and it never ever worked on my phone so yeah it doesn't work.
Glitchy Not what I expected at all I normally like cartoon network that's why I downloaded it but wasn't good at all
Requires internet signal. Will not work by GPS alone.
Unrealistic cops always right on you and only you. Cars appear right in front of you and they handle horribly. I want all my money back. Ea is not willing to do anything about it. I have been an Ea customer since need for speed II in 1997.
It's not letting  everyone verify root
This game is not all that Its hard who ever is reading this I'm telling you don't play it
Slow glitches Its too slow im definitely in installing
I don't like
Kamal When I try to open 8 months option I found it completely dark.
Jungle marble The game has a problem that needs fixing. Marble not lining up as they should also coming from the wrong end.
Cute, fun game but problematic pay design Even if you have infinite honey, you can only earn a few coins per day and you really need those powerful bears to be awake for Chapter 3.
All black As others have commented all black screen after logo. Unable to play at all. Real shame as all the other apps my daughter loves.
Started of good Can't go into town map anymore it gives me a black screen and stays there I paid money for app fix it now Or refund me Thanks I'll give 5 stars when fixed zte majesty 4.1.3 android

Okay It was fun at first, and everything was going nicely until in the animal kingdom it would not let me choose the word clam,
Stupid I cant get in the game when I try to play the screen just stays black
Sucks Game is designed to deal out wins and losses. Determined to achieve a percentage of wins or loses. No random deals.
great more historical years but when I would try to play my favorite dynasty it would load and the game would crash so I couldn't play it
No... just..... no
Do not download this...ever It's literally unplayable
Ads and only hindi Annoyed by ads and most of the questions are Hindi.
My and i love this game because my son can learn how to do house list
Season mode Every update the season heads don't change it stays with this beach ball its so annoying.
Won't work

Glichy The game is so glichy when I mine it doesn't mine the block and I'm glitching in the ground
i can't see my favorite forecast sets Guys, thanks for the app. A comment i have is why don't you give the option to see our custom forecast sets I can't imagine why you didn't do it and if you've done then its not obvious to find it
N
Meh... Could of been better for a dub step app I went through all the sets and there are no drops... Not a single one, its pretty disapointing
Keeps Rejecting my Ads I've tried posting various ads but it gets rejected, saying that it's not allowed.
I know for a fact that I have a virus. But this app says that I'm good. B.S It looks to only scan apps
Gotten Boring With no addtional objectives added in such a long time there is nothing left to play for. With 10 million plus coins and over 3000 gems, what's they're left to try for.
I loved it,,installed played all day got to level 52 went to bed got up tapped app and its still loading been loading for 45 minutes guess I'll uninstall and move on and that sucks cool game
An ad Yep their end is ruined by an advertisement built into the plot. Don't waste your time.
Doesnt work, again Won't run compass or speed on my droid turbo
Ads The ads. You dont need ads where your going to have the answer this is redundant. I would have given it a 5 star
Automatically screen rotates... After opening app the screen rotates automatically... Please fix it.

Can't win know matted what. I'm  not crazy enough to buy fake money just so I can lose it.
Too many connection problems... I haven't been able to connect to play online once since buying. Single player works fine and I love how it plays, but the AI is too easy. Please fix your multiplayer
Black screen I can see the letters names etc. But the screen is all black. Please fix this
Play with friends not working My friend tried to join my game and it said I had a game ready so she clicked it and waited for the game to start but it said there was a server error after about a minute... Plz fix and I'll rate 5 stars
Great game Unenjoyable though Really awesome realistic mechanics instead of classic button mashing which I'm better at..probably Great stuff but difficult unless you pay for everything in the game.
Shutdowns Good game, but a long wait to boot was always an issue. And now, after an update today, it just refuses to start. Gave up without playing a ball after half a dozen restarts in 15 minutes. Get it back on its feet Nautilus
Look, you need to fix the glitches and if you do, I will give you five stars
STILL NO FIX.... Drop another starr. Last update for tablet have connection issue. 610 played game got disconected which only 50 rate of getting reconected. Fix please. I am a royal paying customer.
They lied There is no multiplayer Isn't this false advertisement
Abandoned... Was good app at one time, but has been abandoned by the dev. Hasn't been updated in 2 years... Waste of time and money now.

Just like Vegas..... Just like Vegas except you NEVER lose....its not a game of chance and gets boring  after awhile I have gone from 250.00 to 44000.00 in less then 2 hrs.

Room number does not exist I already paid the VIP but when I tried different room numbers given in the websites, it keeps telling me that the room number does not exist. Waste of money
Love it but hate the AI Would have easily gave it 5 stars but for crys sake fix the AI on this app. It's horrible.  It provides the dominoe that is convenient for the opponent during crucial parts of the game. Very annoying
More effort required Good content but terrible presentation. Really no update visually including the widget for past few months to years almost. There are so many visually stunning weather apps out there.  Please at least have a look at yahoo one.

Dume It is a dume game because I would get it to load but as soon as it is done loading it closes
They stopped giving bonuses. They still won't add levels with fb no extra cards About done with the game. They ruined it
Not working since last update.
Looks nice but gets dull It's fun for a few levels but after you realize it really is  nothing more than a variation on Go or Checkers, and your choices are just limited to moving in one direction, one space at a time.
Does it only go up to level 8 or something Because it keeps flashing the level 8, but I completed that level and won't let me go any further. Fix.

Great while it worked. Worked for thirty minutes then didn't work again.

Frustrated Absurdly long loading screen times or a fault with the game itself Either way, I never actually got to play the game itself as 8min becomes tedious. Shame, as this was a favourite of mine years ago.
Worst I hide some pics in photo vault ,and when i uninstalled it, all my photos were gone
Buggy I can look past some of the glitches, poor graphical choices, and lag. But it became totally unplayable when the character just decided to stop jumping and ducking altogether. Worthless.

Poor problem resolution Have sent several emails to the company to resolve a simple issue, they haven't responded yet.
Keeps forced closing When I type certain sentences, it keeps closing. Hated it
Regular freeze and crash This app regularly freezes and crashes on my phone. This problem only started with the newer releases of the app. I currently have a Samsung Galaxy S5 with Android 5.0
Love the game. But I came one day and my whole team was deleted. So I'm not happy when I was doing pretty good now I have to start all over not happy at all

A baton is not an instrument dumbass. Even if it was, it would be percussion as a percussion instrument is one that is struck. It can be used to hit a stand to help keep time.
Fun Game, need hirez fix Fun game on a phone, but on the awesome Nexus 10 screen all touches map to the top half of the screen, and resizing the view fixes the map to the bottom right corner. Really disappointing.

Zero stars I give this game zero stars. I'm uninstalling it because it freezes up more then it let's me play.

Developer should have put a little thought into how to design the game instead of how to prank people

Great but critical bug I lost a save game after 5 hours of play when play services went down. If a game uses cloud saves it should either have a local backup or be robust to network failures. Other than that a great game,  and well implemented. ..
New update bug When I update to HD version home button is not working 
Not bad
... Okay, there were actually some okay questions in here, but come on If you are making an app about intellectual capabilities, use your brain and fix your spelling and grammar.

HTC evo 4g Got to rank 15 and now it won't open. For how much I paid this should not be happening. An error pops up and says heap O memory is out...
Unfiar Hated it i wanted a refund under 1 hour and they did not give me it every one rate 1star come on guys
Doesn't focus no flash On a nexus 4. Pictures are blurry and using flash freezes app. Phone works fine with Google camera so hardware isn't to blame. Would really like a refund.
Hate it This game is so lame the control are so messed up and you never get to win the shit
Eh It's sweet to see all the pets feel better at the end ' I'm an animal lover' but other than that this game is soo boring, lame and stupid. Toca boca creators please make this free so people don't have to waste there money
This game rocks 
Used to be good for showbox. This app is now a total nightmare. Video buffers every 5 seconds, and if you are using it with showbox it a total waste of time now..... Anyone know of another app that plays showbox videos and can cast them to your telly
Updating Okay but it needs to automatically update like other stations do not worth buying
Waste of money I drove from West wales to Essex and had nothing show at all. Absolute waste of money. Would Not Recommend at all.

Reader I loaded it up and was ready to enjoy some manga and comics and then I realized it had nothing. even searching or trying to download sone but no, i got nothing
Time selection problem It's not user friendly and error prone. Also, even after selecting pick up location properly, it got changed after booking was confirmed.
            
Downloads don't work Get your shite together disney.
Bad game.... The graphics is bad and the controlling is not good
Every time the game updates I lose the ability to tilt to collect the coins on the sides and if I get to a huge gap I die coz I can't jump far enough to keep running
Not good at all Purchased long hair finn then reseted my phone and now its all gone. thanks obama
Lullaby ads Good luck trying to get any sleep with the occasional ad popping in and making noise. Just a moneymaking scam....
... I paused the game and when i was trying to get back to my previous game and it wouldnt let me in untill i rated it.
Really Pop up ads are just irritating. ..only 6 rounds before u make it impossible to go any further...just stupid...almost as bad as actually playing for some stupid tickets....Uninstalled
Game will not play.
The producer has gone back to 2014 by a time machine. He should be creating Real Cricket 2015... Rather than updating Real Cricket 2014 more..
Very bad notesion very bad hopeless aap
Erroneous translation Can't translate a sentence perfectly. Either wrong or incomplete translation. Good for translating a word. But again for it we don't need any app.
Won't Open Crashes on launch on Nexus 9.

Waiting for update... again Well, at least the lag is gone. Buildings are not saved. Went to cave, came back out. Everything i constructed was gone.
This game is the GREEDIEST GAME OF ALL TIME Everything costs money. NOTHING free about it. ENDLESS in app PURCHASES. Loved it at first. Would like to keep loving it. Not going to happen. Goodbye.

I didn't know I didn't know that after one chapter they continuously push for you to become a member and pay them. I don't have the money for this. That's why I've rated it the way I did. Its annoying. Uninstalling immediately.
The amount of ads is incredible. Every single time you finish a turn an ads pops up... gets on my nerves Shame as it's a nice game.
Game is a joke Whatever numbers you are not on will roll to an extreme. Why would they do that Makes the game stupid and unplayable. Don't waste your money.
Updated.. App doesnt work after update Worked until updated app. After updating app, chose to not record anything since the 6th of 2014..
Make BBM moveable to SD card Please you guys should make bbm moveable to sd card. Its consuming all my space and i will soon have to uninstall it.

FIX IT I can't play ANYONE PLEASE FIX IT. THIS IS RIDICULOUS I can not believe I paid for this..  will someone please contact me..... I have Uninstaller and reinstalled FOUR times
My rating used to be 5 stars... For some reason the articles never show up when I click on them now. They just show the loading icon and nothing ever happens.
Nice Fine it is
Installation was not simple.  gave up rather than waste my time
Poor A poor game all round, needs alot of work doing to it to compete with other  similar games
Had to taste 2 stars to review This is crap  You can't use satellite to view maps   and u can't see history either.  I keep track at all of the person.  This sucks  Waste of time
Terrible So this game only gives me videos and musics Nothing else I thought it was about styling our own barbie dolls not only opening web pages
Awful App is awful, a waste of time, it now won't let me uninstall it's slowed my phone right down. I've took it into Vodafone and not even they can deactivate the app. Absolutely appalling
Its  pure rubbish Who ever programmed this wasn't using half of their brain,what's the point of creating a game if win or progress    Horrible waste of   my time. Uninstalled it within 15 min of playing
Neo x8 fix needed to update Aaaahhh what have u done  Update killed my minix  Blank screen and reboot  fix it fix it fix it fix it fix it  D
Hate it That's not the right way to play.
Wont let me play Been playing this game for ages now all of a sudden wont load the game up. Just keeps closing automatically. After paying for this game i expect  to be able to atleast play it
Force close This used to be my favorite game. I would play it for hours to past the time but now I can't even get it yo work past one run. Sometimes it even force closes as soon as I go into the app. This is horrible
Why can't you take all your chips no matter which place in the app you want to go play. I went to the Texas holdem table and only had access to a lousy 100 chips. WTF IS THE POINT, SERIOUSLY 
aaaaaaaaa so irritating bad game when i was about to win a match it says error and all the time irritating adds
It stinks We never get the ball from the oponents.....and bad graphics to describe the football match and players . You have to fix a lot of things  to upgrade things AND GOOD LUCK WITH THAT .
Poor interface but plays chess well I think it needs a lot of improvements to the interface.
Only works on internal list of forums. Does not work on amy forum, please refund my purchase
Fadooo Bad bad

Missing Features Instead of new design I need features like watching activities of others on my account and play Vine and Instagram Videos.
Spider solitaire Flashing ads really annoying and no options of higher levels of play,

Not opening.  Tried several times,, always shows error
Like it but won't close I can't close the app. I am having to hit the home button to get out of the app. This wasn't a problem until the last update. Is there a way this can be fixed
Worthless Give a dollar to charity  don't waste it on this  doesn't work.
Connection Problem It will not connect to the internet while there is a connection, leading to the retry connection screen. This needs to be fixed. The game looks interesting, just need to get past that point of problems with this game.
Error 905 Had to do factory reset of the phone, now Fifa 15 won't download due to error 905. Thought it might be due to the Android Web view update, so I Uninstalled that It worked last time I tried but now that doesn't even work.

Cannot  view  video cuz  of  location Am  in  Mauritius
Sucks Game forces you to pay for gems once you get so far and there is no way to get free gems. You also have no way to delete a building or anything else if you want to get rid of something.
Hichi 
BROKE My daughter loved this app but it No longer works on my daughters Samsung galaxy tab S Very disappointed 
So I bought some packs and waited for them to download and afterwards I had no access to them
Too much childish game... i just wasted my time... huhh...
Great game with bad service I can guarantee you everytime you update,  it will broke something..  The game itself is incredible, so you know what is bad..
Great Game, when it worked I have received a license error and I have tryed all suggested fixes but nothing is working.
Takes too long to load Can't seem to get app to open... takes way too long to load.
Never download this game. This game is really shit
Ads asking if my child is single F this app, deleted instantly Ads asking if my child is single F this app, deleted instantly
No map
Praveen I like that game I like race games
Pete No longer working properly. Was a previous favourite.
Not Reliable after all Very unreliable I had booked a trip and got canceled last minute. Don't rely on this app. They can change your order as they please and wont do anything to help the customer
Will not work Bought this for my son, and there is only audio and no graphics. I have emailed support and as yet no response. Such a shame really
Doesn't work. Tried to use it three times no sucess. Don't waste your .99 cents

Xime L The app is good but first it doesn't connect correctly then when you get in the results take quite of time to be posted
Sucks It lags to much it doesn't even let me punch
Moth Too buggy to deal with.  Keeps crashing... At first it only crashed a few times per day, now it won't run at all.
Good but has some issues I enjoy the game, but the chat gets full and there is no function to clear it  and once it is full no new messages will populate.  If the data is lost you cannot retrieve the player code as the button does nothing
Bonus taken away I purchased the hat upgrade and it stopped working in less than 24 hours. I paid money for it and I would like the upgrade back. I will rerate this app if and when I get what I have paid for.
No choice on refund Installed didnt work went to refund in google store just said uninstall very dispointed plus cant contact company terrible customer service wont use these again
Too difficult Gameplayvis nice, graphics are very nice but the AI is way to hard to beat seems like every other at nat they get a HR I have yet to get a HR can barely get on base
Ads interrupt Too many pop up ads The app is nice. Remove ads for more stars.
Not worth it don't get it U have to buy everything everything is locked
Very disappointing. ..fix it Was all the way done with game waiting for new levels...now I have to start all over again...lost everything

Error message Error Marmalade v6.06  Exception occurred in glinit. Cant even go past ea screen..   galaxy s5 user
Micromax A315 Faltu kabhi download mat karna
Laggy and bad graphics None of the animations are fluid. The game looks like its running at like 10fps. Also, the textures are a very low resolution and look pixilated.
Not authorized for use on my tablet Sucks, when I open the game it just says not authorized for use on this android device. Tablet z. Why not A game like this is much more fun on a tablet than on a phone.
Ok Half of them are locked
Love this game but..... I love playing this game but since yesterday the game won't load at all. It keeps saying that I have no internet connection and clearly I have one since I'm able to rate this.
The apple part is hard I thought it was ok but it was not but the rest is ok OH NO
Weak Ps photo is way better
Bad Nothing good
Really Keeps shutting off after every level finished. Just takes me back to my home screen.
Laggy For a game as simple as this, i should not have to deal with 15 crashes everytime I want to play a game
Copied UI of the ICC CWC 2015 App. Material UI is very poor for the Richest Cricket boards official android app..And it seems to b waste most of the times as its not possible to refresh the content neither any interesting UI...
Man what happened.... Use this app all the time for when I do billboard installs. Keeps reverting to auckland... Be alright if I didnt live in Hamilton... Super frustrating
Good but glitchy It's very glitchy graphics wise it the graphics going all wrong and freaking out and jumping out everywhere
Shame  Please update your app to improve performance  graphics. Also when you buy an app you should put away advertising  Last update 1 year ago  How is it possible Do something
brain pop Jr. i tried to download it but it did in,t work don't down load it
Im not happy that it wont open..keeps saying no connection and im not about to start over again because I bought a lot of those stars and I can't change my clothes in keeps force closing
Wont let me open It let me open it for the last two weeks. Now it just says loading assets then proceeds to say unfortunately it has stopped. I have reported it 3 times and no change. I'm uninstalling. Fix it and I will definitely install again.
Down Hill Was such a good game with smooth graphics but since recent updates graphics are patchy some daily missions won't load and targets don't appear in some games as it times out. Please fix these bugs.
Terrible Dont waste your time.
Worst game Always hang up and time out
Login Screen freezes logging in. Won't open, had to uninstall, reinstall...worked once and now will not login again. Disappointed
Hate it When I get to this 1 spot it does that one thing would you like to report this gamethis game is stupid never get it
Love the game but it lacks multilayer One of my favourite games here and in board version. I was happy to see a 3.0 update but then got greatly disappointed by the lack of multilayer. What's with the android version that it can't have a multilayer
Share function missing from the menu Accessed the menu from the recents button but the share option is missing.
Npc cars The other cars are just horrible I stop because a car is in front and a diffrent car just comes crashi g into me Make the cars smarter and ill do 5 stars but for now uninstall.

I don't like it To me,it's not fun.It's like playing Dumb Ways to Die.And to say, I like to play that rather than playing this game.So lousy.......
This app bites Downloaded and then dumped.  For Free,  the letter sounds stop at H Really If I could give it 0 stars I would have. Thanks for nothing.
Vince Finished all 312 puzzle pieces.  Theres no puzzle anywhere.  Fun to play. End result SUCKED.
Doesn't work No games showing when I open the app, waste of money.
Game great but.... The game is fun but it keeps crashing on me and is irritating as heck
I only picked 1 star becuz it only go up to level 8 I will give more stars if u fix it until then 1 star for me
Too expensive Plus they're using fake ratings It's true. You're basically going to have to unlock buy over half the items to use to include kitchen tools, toppings, food, etc. This is just a quick get rich scheme, foh. UNINSTALL
What a stupid I hate this app I never this type of apps ohhhh my foot
Doesn't work Cannot input name to Play
No live streaming
Crashing on ep3 Great game up to the end of episode 2, but game is now crashing at the load screen for episode 3.  Waste of money.  No forums seem to address this issue.  Fix please. Android 4.4.2. Samsung galaxy s4 mini. Ta.
Stupid It doesn't work like it dose on the picture, I should have known it wouldn't cuz of the name all u do is press buttons THAT'S IT it's such a STUPID game
Bugs Lots of bugs when used between PC and Android. And the transfer speeds are so slow. Pen drive transfers in much better speed without any fuss. It takes some attempts to connect with my Windows PC. It's annoying
Bad data counter This last update has the data usage counter giving inaccurate readings.  Went to bed on wifi at 75 woke up next morning at 124 According to my carrier I was only at 1.34gb of usage for the month which is not 124.   Needs to be fixed.
Ads and popups in paid version DO NOT BUY You absolute scum. Ads in a paid version. I will NEVER buy an app from you again.
Sunny Love it how do you hate this game you are haters
Won't let me log in to join, just bought a colorado and is frustrating not being able to try out the sat navigation system because this won't let me sign up
I never got to play the game it kept freezing as soon as I would turn it on it would freeze ill never purchase a game this company makes ever again.
Doesn't work Paid for pro yet all features still locked and tells me i need pro
Soon as I downloaded the game it stopped whats all that about.
Can't place the ladder to continue the game. So I'm currently stuck
doesn't deserve even a single star, I wasted my data
Ads I bought the game so I wouldn't deal with the ads.
Worked fine till update Loved game till update. Now at start of each new game when Ad comes up, I have to close program and reopen or screen stays black
You'd think someone like Activision would know what they're doing. Here's a thought. Let's make that can at least open. I guess the Activision team that makes apps aren't very bright.
Doesn't work Seems like the same issue everyone else is having using an android device 
Regrettably, no matter what configuration I tried I could not get CaroO Pro to operate on my Note 4 with dash cam feature enabled without a VERY significant batter drain.
Buggy The balls do not follow the path that is displayed on the screen.
Ad at top of screen is blinding when looking at sky. Get rid of ads and I will rate 5 stars.
Bigvegas1 I had over 455 diamonds yesterday and today I have 5 I've been working hard to get those diamonds and the game cheated me out of them
Need static IP 
Work well on HTC One X. Disappoint about premium codec not include. And material design not implement.
So what did I get for the money From what I see I only got a few more.... am I missing something. I thought I was getting the whole lot more than just a few
So so Disappointed with typhoon two arms only... very repetitive but nice.. but also very low funding not nice. But not worth wat I paid for the game.
Wow, can't even view the map BC of ads Sucks.  Um, I'm not an idiot. I clicked the x and the ads just keep popping up. Uninstalling
Actually getting worse Hard to believe, but each update makes the UX slightly more unintuitive.
Useless app By using this app we can only compare all Cab fares...bt we cant book Cab by using app..so only for fare comparison why should we use this app
Was brilliant now not so much Its pretty buggy now,  doesn't have that light feeling it once did.
Poor stuff Doesn't worth the money.
Fun but keeps crashing So frustrated that everytime an ad interrupts, the whole app crashes And I've to restart the app over and over again. Pls fix.
Network error Today i installed this game and i open to play this game requires update 166 but it didnt run then it says error with connection issue i check my connection its working how can i get it to patch please help me
Couldn't get in Every time I try to go into the app it sends me to the last page I was on. I even downloaded it 3 time and I still doesn't work.
Bakwas games hai
Same Same to me morgan it does not work
Didn't work 4 me  10,000 Ads Didn't work for my Samsung BluRay player and every single little thing you do  triggers an ad to pop up, and I mean EVERY. I remember some of the ad and those I will never download them ever, because of this program app.
There is zero need for this, this can easily be build into any app.
I can't install This won't download data in my device, I have kitkat with a sdcard 32 gb, I know problems with this but when this would be solved in an app purchased.
Uninstalled Uninstalled due to everyone I try to play something unreliable Internet connection pops up. Everything else working fine on my Internet ty
Not even You call that a game lmao
No images I played the games but there was no pictures for the elements.
Does not work Four times I have contacted you and had no response. Why 
Love Sporcle But the app is terrible. Considering I paid for this app it should actually work, but it never really has on any device. It rarely opens to anything other that a blank screen Not worth the money, waste of time.
To easy It's to easy but I hate dogs because he ate my pet bunny' .I should had not have two bunnies and one dog I hate this day
Hate the updates Please fix the double pinning and please create a paid adfree app. I would prefer to purchase your app if it means getting rid of all of the useless ads. I hate all of them, they are intrusive and offensive.
Great game, but.. No access to purchase downloadable content... Just hour glass. It seems this is a common issue with this game on androids. Once they fix that, I'll rate this 5
This horrible Delayed reactions, ads hijacked my phone.  This app needs serious work.
Nothing is matching Nothing is matching the reality
Baaaaaaaaad Like i couldn t even hear the song.the volume waz up to 100
Boring and not interesting
Fun and Lag I love this game its fun. I have it for my iPod touch and my 360. So I know this game. So pleeeeease fix the bad lag. Fix it so I can have it on my phone.
Good, but... The game is great and all.... But its a shame that you have to pay to actually play with ease...I hope you guys make a free one
Mind of its own The ball could at least go where I touch and not anywhere it wants to. It's amazing how the consistently curves away from where I direct it. Delete and uninstall. Not worth the frustration. Deleted all games from this developer.
Why after purchase Weatherproof HD For Tablet it shows PRO not enabled and ask for 6 months or 3 months pay Why Canadian city shows in Cuba Will request refund.
Additional charges  I have just only bought 1 applicationsally's salon luxury. But why my credit card being charged for 3 itemsMarketplace, RealArcade  Seller Could anyone help to advise
Read  Weep The money paid by gamers does not go into the graphic design.  The graphics remain at a playstation 1 level. The blonde lady must of cost a bundle via. the mole.
Stupid You could just play random notes and it says you are playing correctly. And I can't even get a sound out of it but when I played a different game the sound was perfect. It shouldn't get any stars.
Crashing I like the game but after a few race it crashes. And then I need to restart my phone which is a note 4. Plz fix and I'll give better review
Not worth your money This is something your child would easily get bored with
Diane. Can not get this game to work on my  Samsung galaxy tab 4. It's hopeless Ltd just want work I've deleted it and downloaded it again and it want work gave up now.
Doesn't work on Nexus 5. Can see intro and that's where it ends.
It will not open on my Acer iconia A1830 Every time I try to start this game I go to a black screen and that's it Would be great if this worked since I kick started it and have waited a while for it to get on the android. Pls fix this problem
Stupid game How ever made this  are stupid because it dont even work
It won't let me do anything
Abandoned So it is abandoned. Developer responding to the random comments, to keep ppl thinking that they still working on it. Just the potential money from new buyers. No comments on subjects to be commented.
I have given this game months and reinstalled hoping it would be fixed and nothing.
No, so good Sometimes when I play versus IA that no play anymore and I have than restart the game, sorry by the bad English
NOt so GooD It nEed a lot of improvements.  The App is hanging often.  And you should provide atlest chatting option free.
Terrible Would not even open just kept forcing app to close   Shocking Very upset 2 year old.
Kya game hai yar bakwaas
Dumb It's just plain stupid. Like after you're done cleaning her and her hair it goes back to the home screen.
Cannot log in I'm an active lvl 40 player but since 1.60 update I cannot log in with my phone  unfortunely summoners war had stopped. My phone is samsung note 2.So I changed my review to 1 star. Please fix ASAP...
spam spam accounts start games and then never respond, now I have to wait for a new game. boo.
Does not even run Blank screen.
Downloading problem. Asking to download extra content, but after 90 or before that the download stops and restarts. Not working at all. It's not working in asus zenfone 4.. please fix that..
Too easy Crap game, far too easy, no fun at all.
Too hard Need to hit a boundary every ball to stand any sort of chance. Design to make you pay to win. Will be deleting
I can log in but... When I want to unfollow users who did not follow me back, I have to wait for about 60 seconds than I can unfollow them all. Why it's so late to unfollow one user So weird Lol
Ads I understand why there are Ads but do they really have to constantly flash while you're tryin to concentrate on a card game
Doesn't Load I'm on Hudl 2 and doesn't load stuck at load screen I gave it 30mins but nothing  waste of fuing money
Won't even open......... It seemed fun so I downloaded it. It won't even fricking open Stupid.
How much is the advanced version How much is the advanced version I have tried the support website, calling support, searched via google but I cannot find how much it costs. I am loathe to click Upgrade Now in case I get charged.
No. Just no Why do I need to pay for a 4 chapter manga I want to read persona Q and I cannot... Only a manga with a little amount of chapters
Cant Can't play adventure mode
BOOOH Cannot be open.contacted google for refund but still charge to the app that is useless. Money , time wasted and device space eater. Uninstall
Dislike it It won't let me move at all when you begin the game.... 2 stars.... not the best app at all
Hate it.
Controls do have problem
Not free After 3 levels the game demands  its entertainment value is ok.
Save ur time for not installing this Full of bugs. Damn wasted my time
Not Worth It You have to download a second app for weather which without you cant use this app by itself. In this day and age when space is precious because of growing apps, needinganything other than what you already downloaded is ridiculous.
Bad game Not even a game,very very easy. Can even make a move.
My pictures thing dosent work I cant progress in the game without it 5 stars iif you fix.
Gets disconnected I couldn't even finish a single game. Every time something happens and gets disconnected. I hoped for a nice game but I couldn't find one. If there was an option for zero stars, I would have given you that.

This game has a lot of bugs to fix The music is not in sync with the character which is the whole point, everytime you pause the game the music starts over and I die automatically Developers, you have some work to do.
No good I as an adult had a hard time understanding how to play the game.  Once I figured it out the game shut down halfway through each snowcone build. I don't think my 4 year old was going to enjoy it.
Not for kids of  2. Every game seems very poorly designed for kids.
Won't allow me to open it on FB Can't open it on FB, denies my email password. Paid 2.99 for an app I can't play. Any suggestions
Some issue updating game data There is no problem with my Internet connection but the game won't work. Don't bother with this
Was good... Won't connect to Facebook, progress lost and can't play with friends which ruins the game completely
Outdated. I usually hear about upcoming Jordans from other sites way before they're even mentioned on this app... I honestly only check the app once every 3 or 4 months but it doesn't update often enough for even that sometimes. Use to be better.
Doesn't work Bought it a long time ago and just downloaded it again and doesn't work on my Note 4, I'm pretty sure it didn't work when I first bought it either, please fix
Buttons Does not work properly. Should have been fun game but it makes you angry and no more fun

Doesn't work My three year old loves peppa pig but this app doesn't work. She gets upset and she's unhappy doesn't deserve a star. This should be taken down or fixed.

Game balks  refuses to work, but the ads certainly keep on just fine Uninstalled

They're Just 4 lulubys and number 1and4 and number2and 3 are the same.  
Freezes after every level

Latest update screwed the pooch It was working fine until the latest update. Now it won't even load. Already tried uninstalling then reinstalling to no effect. Android 4.4.2. LG LS660.
 It does not have come little children. So im mad. It also has a twilight song which is not my little pony and it is song 6. Listen really closely to it.
Developed a major bug When skipping to my next shift, the play is immediately stopped with a whistle... and the stats get screwed up faceoffs are recorded as being won by both players, shift counts are wrong or unrealistic etc

Samsung galaxy tab 2 I'm on my 15th generation I have over 3.5 million. Yet I've never found any bugs and only 23 the twigs. Really needs some updates for something else u can do. Why not be able to buy a new house
Horrible Lag I have an LG G4. Top of the line specs and still the lag interferes with gameplay. Dissapointed. Should have tried demo first.
This game is incredibly stupid. Most of it doesn't even make sense, and starting from the beginning is annoying. The artwork is sloppy and the sound effects ts are childish and stupid.
Boring Paid for it, too 
Terrible. Sounds are just awful.
I don't really like this game because I can't get everything and I can't buy it Horrid can't get stuff
Whyyy Why can i no longer swap characters, i have a hunter and i started the new character but i cant get back on my hunter.. very upset because its level 55 and ive put money into this game..
Very bad               
Problems with mor problems I love the game, but the technical issues are getting on my nerves. Also the time clock for your ranking is short, it just a tactic to spend your coins.
Booo You have to win the things by games and there's multiple boxes if you choose the wrong one you have to redo the games like the 1 millionth time I've done this please fix this
Too much RUBISH It contains a lot of virus     after installing my I pad got hanged    and didn't start again
Bangar game It cant be played
Cannot hear any voice. Nimbuzz is not even able to connect to the echo test. There is no problem with my internet connectivity. I bought Nimbuzz credit but its useless now.
Style book Whenever I am going in the style book its just loading and the screen is going blank please put a feature that in the game only we can do the style book

Cost me my monthly 2 gigs of data to upload a few short videos. Not  pleased at all.... Ugh. Battery sucker. Galaxy note 3 2 batteries a day.
Cannot open app on my device
Was so great before the last update Great simple design, but these new unskippable 30 second animated ads are deplorable. I'm okay with ads for such a great free app, but the video ads are a step too far.
New graphics .. Is just bad. Used to love the game, but now it is barely payable because of the new graphics.
It does not let you jump when you try it on your own

Updated to the latest version and now when I try to load my trips... The app just closes.
Lame
Crash crash crash. Oneplus one. Game occasionally force closes and, after reopening, restarts, deleting all unsaved progress. Amazing game, not worth the money if I have to do everything twice. I'll just emulate it for free....
Lost all my data for no reason Give my data backI lost 5thousand coins and lots of weapons....GIVE IT BACK
Not all games working On my gen 1 nexus 7 and lollipop not all the games work. Some just start the leave an empty screen.

No fun anymore Been waiting and waiting and waiting for more sticker pages yet every update you do doesnt include those. I now have 14 sticker packs waiting unopened for more sticker pages. Please give more sticker pages soon.
From 5 stars to 1 And 0 if i could...my problem was that boomsound on my m8 goes on and off every sec and it was so annoying and this app is the reason
Not installing No matter how much I try, it won't install on ms HTC DESIRE. Always starts to download, but it gets stuck at 140 mb, and won't install. I have 1GB of free space on my SD card...
Clothes are ugly The clothes are so ugly, all of my sims look like hobos. Why do you keep taking the good outfits away Im Really disappointed by this. It should be just like the computer version.
Ads Pay 2 to watch ads Sign me up
Update keeps crashing Love this game but new update is very buggy. Very slow, it's painful and it crashes every time I add friends or try to help them. It's just too clumsy to play now so I've just stopped until there is some kind of fix.
No longer working Working fine on other devices but freezes and restarts whole device on tab S t805 since I got lollipop. Really need fix to get it back to 5 stars
Doesn't work Stopped working with my Galaxy S5 and doesn't work with my Galaxy S6

Becomes unplayable after you run out of soldiers. I thought you'd get more over time but no you have to buy them or hope a Facebook friend will play the game and give you more
Collection of ads Uninstaled...
What even I have watched Sims 3 playthroughs on youtube and they are nothing like this. What a rip off
A Pain Very disappointed in this game. When you click the fruit to match it takes forever to match. What a waste. Game would be good if not for that problem.
Does not work Orientation sensor required. Don't know what more it requires...
My son is heartbroken Doesn't work on Lollipop. I'm as distressed about this as my son is.
Ads OMG with these ads that pop up loudly and you can't stop 100 NOT worth whatever fun the game might have been.
Lollipop Please fix for android 5 lollipop.  I'll rate this game five stars after that.
HORRIBLE AT BEST Just bought this and can't even open it up. Had it for about 8 hours and still can't open it up. DONT GET THIS APP

Note 3 and note pro 12.2 I dropped my rating from 5 to 2 stars, do to no support from the developers. Sent 2 emails, with no replies Used to be awesome support for the launcher but not no more.

Too Slow Can you make it more smooth it lags alot and its definitely not my phone that causes this. It's the app
Very bad game It is just wast of time
Love the game, but no save state Great game, runs smooth. But no save state, so if you close your phone in the middle of a 45 min battle, you lose all progress. Extremely frustrating.
Help.....Error Maybe I opened it and it checked for updates then while checking it said check your connection I had 4 WiFi bars and my internet works just fine can some help me
Hated it I would give it a 0 but i had to give it a star to right something
Why can't I train GLADIATORS when I have researched Heavy Infantry level 28 and I have Barracks level 30 It says You cannot train this troop in this city and no list of requirements aside from Gold and Food.
Really Constantly steering left and ads after every load screen Thats crap.
Keeps crashing Used to work until 3 weeks ago and now it says things like cannot connect to server even though I am connected, and it also keeps crashing. Really thought this was a 5 star app until 3 weeks ago, now I'm just annoyed with it.
Waste of data I dont know why such worthless apps are being created
Pathetic app Get a new developer to design a decent app and maintain it. Absolute joke how pathetic this version is, from being ugly and cumbersome to navigate to just plain not working.
Useless Why does it work on ios but not on android as a free app. Please fix this ASAP.
Too many issues I liked the game itself,the constant loading issues are very annoying.Game is updated,WiFi available,still keeps stopping. Work on the constant network issues and I will increase the rating,until then 2 's

Sucks Everything is locked
Poor user interface No context of who's move it is on resuming, can't see topic on daily double, freezes requiring battery pull, and no multiplayer online.  1990 design.
Can't play the game at all. Loads to 65, click sign in as guest. Didn't work. Sign up and verified my account with kabam, tried to login to the game, didn't work.
Need a refund of my acorns I bought acorns and now they restarted my account...i want the to refund atleast the acorns....

The page doesn't work and links are gone
Loved it but... Been playing it for months, latest update says 'failed to initialize hardware' and refuses to run on my TF101. If it's not compatible it shouldn't have downloaded an update. How do I roll back
Any one can cheat.... what a game.... hatzz offf.....
Dirt bike king The game is good, QUIT TRYING TO SELL ME LEVELS. THE APP SUCKS BALLS.  They constantly try and sell you stuff, other games, levels, mods, and coins.  F this
Pop ups prevent winning The game wouldn't be bad if the stupid pop up ads didn't interupt in the middle of the song and make you mess up. Bullshit

Broken Auto fight needs to send off hits faster. having 6 seconds at max without it firing makes you lose fights in pvp arena.
Really I bought gold membership. I got everything. But a few minutes later, it all just disapeared Now I have to buy everything again I would like a refund of 1.99
What is this
Looks like the devs gave up No updates to this games in months, and the last two regions they released only had one level each. This seems how glu operates and they can't be trusted.
x5 e53 4.8is 2005 no 4.8 engine on the list to choose from

J'habite a Maurice et l'appli gulli ne marche pas
Good app, but a few problems. Completely started me over from level 26, to level 1. I love the game but please fix this issue.
Ad central My 2 year old can stay on this program for 5 seconds before hitting an ad that sends him to all places on the Internet having nothing to do with kids But for 2.99 mon you can remove the ad Not worth it deleting this immediately

Freezes My game freezes after completing the waterfall in Act1 the library milkshake land. I am so disappointed after the higher cost of this game. Have emailed and will wait and see  I was enjoying it immensely until then. Such a shame.
Where is sketchbook I had sketchbook on my note3 and now I can't find it and it's the only app missing from my app. I should always have access to an app I paid for and this app pales in comparison
Shit

The game crashes Every time that an add comes the game completely crashes You guys need to fix that because i cant play it at all It is crashing all the time With this kind of quality you guys wont be able to get a 5 star rating from people
Waste of money This always gets frozen after some percent scan and couldn't pass that. Also retrieves duplicate photos and even the non deleted ones. Not helpful and wasted money on this crap.
Worst Bus tracking ever It is if the bus tracking app has a life of its own. Zoom is kak, and you cannot read the names of the stations on the map.
Doesnt work on my tablet Samsung tab 2, I can hear the  sound but the screen is blank
Soo laggy, even if you check the person they can shoot from far away and still make it......very disapointing. Dont waste your money on this
I hate what they did to this game. When it was just you playing against the computer it was awesome. Now they put these stupid characters in there to F it all up. I am glad I still have the old version on my other note.
Don't like it don't get it dumb game don't you waste your time on this game Same
Network error ruins arena events How could you guys consider an error in establishing connections to be the player's fault After losing streaks so many times because of this, I begin to think you guys aren't serious in maintaining this game.
LACK OF PROMO it has an offer wall that of you comply it does not give you the gems you deserve the game owes me like 3,000 gems and nothing.

Podcasts are behind a few weeks or months Seems like im having a few troubles getting all my podcasts to sync. Some podcasts are about 45 episodes behind and when i use another podcast to check, they are all up to date except for Pocket Casts.
WTF A piece of shit. Saying more is waste of time.
Bakwassssssss
Has gotten worse with each update. Freezes constantly. Don't waste your time
A limit of how much pictures you can heart an hour. There is a max limit to heart each hour. Seriously That's so pathetic.  GET PINTEREST GUYS. ITS BETTER.
Update ruined it Now it doesn't acknowledge that I have the donation version. Won't let me hibernate system apps, and keeps trying to hibernate apps that I already hibernated. Ready to uninstall.
Requires Internet connection Though the game is quite good  but Can't play it without Internet. Utter waste of space.
Not my kind of game Way to many ads. Uninstalled
Problems transferring game data I can't get the data from my tablet to my phone I'm stuck on level 1 box 1 on phone but on tablet I'm almost half way through season 2 plz help and I will give 5 stars
Scary af So i wanted to try some stuff out on my own and im on level 3 and she is still a baby and if you cover the camera her eyes look up until you move your finger away from it

special bus i like excetive move
Loads maybe half of any given page Loads only gray squares for most of the pages of all of my comics. How you expect anyone to use this app is beyond me.
Downloaded and nothing. No sound. Beautiful App, but useless.
Money I can't get money from the game , i just get money from pension and thats sucks , fix it
This app is  very convincing,  but it wont open. DON'T DOWNLOAD.  WASTE OF TIME
Omg It sounds like crap
Too expensive Amazing game I would pay 5 dlls no more to unlock All features, but 99.99 dollars to get 350k coins is crazy. That is one Xbox game plus all dlc packs or my phone bill plus enough to go to the movies twice.
What's the point if it can't determine direction Looks very nice but direction is way off... it thinks SE is N. Can't find a way to calibrate. Boourns.
It sucks You can't do any thing
IT'S A TRAP My 3 year old enjoyed it for 2 seconds then BAM her comes the you need to pay for this and that. One lame section isn't worth the memory.
Good game. Starting to have problems though. Really loved the game... But for the last month or so its been having game play issues. Had to uninstall and reinstall to get it to work. Have to do that every time I play an event or bonus game. Smh
Retarded Doesn't matter what device but the on screen keyboard does not display properly, preventing me from playing because you cannot get past that screen.  You absolutely have to enter a name.  So dumb.

Again won't open 1.0.6 I don't know why none of your games will open on my tablet anymore. They used to work.
All american foods Most people outside america wouldnt see half these foods. The scoring is also a bit unfair try cutting it back to 100 instead of 30
For a game that cost money This game is way too glitchy. It's impossible to finish some missions and level up guys. There should be an option to pay to skip missions
It won't let me follow people It was fine in the beginning but now I can't follow anyone.  Fix it if not im uninstalling.  And people shouldn't download this if its gonna do that.
Boring.. This is so sick I hate it, why can't there be more clothes

Bubble shooter glitches Waaay too many glitches. Some levels are designed for you to lose many times over. Don't like how it calls you a loser when you lose a level rather than just say lose. Would be lots more fun once all these are corrected.

Please help. Before i changed my phone i purchased every option. And after changing it, everything disappeared. If you fix that i will rate 5 stars. Thank you
Ads Why are there ads in the paid version of my game I wouldn't have bought this app had I known I'll eventually get ads anyway. It's a shame because it's a fun  simple game that me and my toddler enjoy.
Doesn't work properly on  Micromax A104.

My chopper crashed and my data went with it This thing doesn't save Also no free play
Awful Terrible app. And, lots of you are idiots,,, there phone Where phone,,,,,, try their phone. And no it does not work. Intrusive obnoxious adds. The only thing it is good for  is add spamming, which it is very effective at.
It's good service for the people, Srilanka
Not insured user Not able to use app anymore. All info recorded lost.
Google rip off Billed three times to different companies repeatedly. I hope profile is fake I can't talk to the woman if this is real it's cruel to treat people like this. Sorry I ever thought this was more than a scam
0s 1 Doesn't show whether a tweet has been sent or not. As soon as I press enter the message disappears .       2 Locating previous contacts after re installation is absolutely dismal.
Im stuck in the wall Entered a cave now im stuck between 2 walls with no way out. Dafuq kind of bug is that.
You have to pay You get the first month free but have to pay after that. That i don't have an issue with it is the fact they ask for credit card details stright up before even trilling the app. I haven't even tried the app itself not sure how secure.
Spam Bought paid version years ago. Recent update has brought ads and daily spam notifications. Deleted  trying to find an old version until fixed.
Good Good good good good good good good good good

Don't like update I don't like update since it does not keep score any longer. When I paid for it it kept score. Also it does not have difficulty levels as clear as before the update . Please bring back the original game I paid for
System crashes on Samsung s4. Love the pc app but this software is buggy
   Gps            
Absolutely awful. Awful game there are no instructions and no reverse it's awful don't bother installing you'll just be disappointed.
Can't back up my achievements They should make the expense of their game worth it. And not being able to backup my achievements does not.
Stop It keeps on loging me out
Sneakers are gone All the releases are gone. Did you update the app or something
Sad This is a huge disappointment. I expected a good quality game but all I got was a low resolution, hard to understand, boring game. Do not pay money for this.
Good game but it doesn't let you win enough to play and bonuses are small. Wish you could actually play for longer than 2 minutes.
Doesn't work whatsoever on asus zenfone 2 Exactly as i said. Worked perfectly on my xperia z ultra before I switched phones.
Worst game ever Literally The worst game I've every played, it doesn't allow me to move the character instead the little ball thing that moves him had a mind of its own wtf literally going the opposite way. Thanx for wasting my time.

Finish one round exits outs of game get that fixed with the adds that pop up at the most random times so I accidentally click on them need to go annoying as hell
Liked I did enjoy playing this game but now it takes forever to start and when it comes up all I get is a blank screen. Very unhappy and disappointed.....
Great, short game I was thoroughly enjoying this game and it's  immersion until I realized that it is just one chapter in the story. Maybe 2 hours of play for 5 is the return I like to get from my purchases.
wtf did I download it's not like the picture AT ALL. the lasers just make noises vibrate, big disappointment.
Not working Can someone please fix it is not even working every time i pull it up the screen goes black..please fix i am starting to get agitated
Useless Get Could not move file error when trying to move files from ed card to phone storage. Even just moving one file. Also, nags every few seconds to give feedback do you like our app. Annoying, useless, uninstalled. HTC Amaze.
Disgusting Even after cancelling the trip the driver called that he has reached to pick me up. Just a poor app..in simple english.
Doesn't work No activity after loading
Great app. Has stopped dowloading info recently on galaxy s4
Loses Connection Ever since the last update it gives me nothing but problems.  Constantly loses Connection and when you think you have it working it freezes and screen says device disconnected.  Please fix this as I would like to enjoy it again.
Can't print or save to camera roll Please tell me how to print to my wireless printer or how to save to the camera roll. I hope I didn't just waste 3.99. When I click the buttons, nothing happens at all.
You never win Like the computer always wins I will give it a better rait if u fix that
Worst game ever not even opening properly Bekar
Solitaire Like the game but can't stand the ads after each game  I would rather pay for the game and do away with ads for things I would NEVER buy
Lol Are you people really that dumb that you thought a laser would shoot out of the phone When you bought your phone, did it come equipped with a laser This is just a mindless children's app. Idiots...
SUCKS You only get 5 options
Still have some problems. MOST of the app works but some things keep saying there is a problem with app please send email. But when I do,  the email wont send the file. Good thing a didnt spend a lot on this app.
does not work on android 5 lolipop
Wrong If you click on a game and by accident click off it takes your tokens. And it does not let you play the game.
Really boring knock off of flabbybird
I would give five stars but... It won't accept my answer FLINESTONES so please fix it ..and my answer is correct
What's the point of purchasing this app if you still have adds
Worst game ever This game needs more development to improve not just graphics. Also fluidity on movements of the characters.
Missing feature There is no cast screen feature on my galaxy s4.  I looked it up and many, many people also have this issue.  There better be a good reason why they STILL haven't fixed it by now.

Painfull and frustrating Poor quality. Slow loading. Bonus games are pathetic. No special anything's with the free games. You will unistall.
Hate it I will take stick cricket over this game anyday. Horrible gameplay, and not much to do. Some batting moves you are not able to perform and is hard even if the difficulty is set on easy. Horrible, hands down
whaaattt ttthhheee heelll i've reached level 190 above  after update .. iy has started from the beginning... wt the hell plz plz plz plz fix this
Uninstalls itself after opening The app immediately uninstalls itself upon opening on my Samsung Galaxy S5 with a paired Samsung Gear smartwatch. This is a longstanding issue that has precluded me from using this app on this device.
Cant log in Please fix this problem. Its been doing this for some time now.
This is the best app but Has been filtered in iran..
The thought the light would come out of the phone...... Like in the picture..... I was so disappointed when I did it If you are reading this comment, don't waste your time with this app....
Thisgame sucks We all DO have a reliable connection you jerks This game FAILED HARD 
App freezes I love this game and play all the time. However, recently, the app has started to freeze as soon as someone plays their first line of trains.

VESA Managing
The smart list update makes it hard to find anything, nothing is in any sort of order that makes sense
Bought it, can't access lessons I bought this last night, and I still cannot access all of the lessons. It says buy all lessons for 199, but Google play says I already own it. 5 stars when fixed.
Ruined I'm addicted to BR , reading about 100 stories a day , but I can't load new stories now . Please fix it .
Every time I try to do a song it says I must be a vip player and if not it sends me back to the home page and says an error has occurred. I'm not going to pay 7 to dance when I can play it on my wii with no worries. I'm done with this fricken game
Absolute garbage Quite possibly the worst worms rip off I've ever seen. Horrible aiming mechanics, terrible selection of weaponry, and overall a Grundy feeling sort of game. This game is free and still i feel i paid too much for it
Won't even download Uggghhhhhhhh
Bakwas ha
I want all my money back I tried to play this game today in a message pop up and said it was an unlicense wedding dash error. Wth
Don't bother downloading Its stupid and boring. I had it for a half hour and I regret wasting that much time of my life. Uninstalling.
New version is annoying The adverts which pop up are very frustrating. If I have my phone on silent for multimedia the adverts still come on at full volume. Fax it please Previous version was excellent.
Terrible It won't even let me in once I created a character it shot me out the app. I have tried over 10 times. I wish I could give this app a zero. If the fix it I will give it a better rank
Very bad Waste app no one replies properly to ur text everyone say just one word hai and go off  Waste app
Game good but But playing with off spinner is damn tough can't predictable. Just improve on that
Good game BUT Just like with Westbound addicting game but can't advance due to constant server crashes and the need to complete offers for or buy swords.
Boo The controls suck please fix or im uninstalling it
Crashes often Worked fine for a while, now it always crashes or won't even open.
Worst Apps I've ever used
All my stuff is gone I bought a fair amount of inapp purchases but when my phone broke and i got a new one, i cant restore my purchases
So bad Allways crashing so adds no levels
Grossly inaccurate There are over 90 of fixed cameras MISSING in my county of England, 100 of mobile camera sites missing, and zero of the other safety related warnings.  Therefore, this app is worse than USELESS.
BAD
Meu filho adora os videos, mas depois do ultimo upgrade perdi todo o contedo que havia comprado e uma verso em ingls apareceu no meu telefone. Um absurdo
Needs quick improvements This game sucks. We should be allowed to buy a vowel while trying to solve the puzzle. And if we don't get it, the system should tell you the word, phrase.
I hate it It won't stop going to slick craft and slick craft is ugly and horrible
Needs work Keeps telling me I need at least 10 characters. I have like 100. Tells me to complete all sections when I have. So therefore I can't list.
wont load just main screen
What is this crap How is this game even in the store The balls are squares with a circle in the middle, this is so weird and stupid. Not smooth at all
Crap dice I expect the dice would be more like moodoo marble or Line's let's get rich. It's still random, but at least have a little bit more control than this. It always give me bad numbers always go to snake. Maybe my expectation is too high.
Halarious I scared my mom and dad so good they were both cleaning dishes and bam They jumped 
Keeps force closing Can't even get inside to play the game... I'm not taking the refund because I believe in you guys but please don't let me down. I have a ZTE Android phone.
It won't even open on my nook without crashing Only one star dude like its not for nooks
Wacky wacky wack... I can make even better app than this.... What a waste of time...
I hated it it freezes and takes you to the store and won't let you go back there is more pets than people are saying but I hate it
Runs slow on Galaxy Note 4 ATT. I don't know what has been changed but it has introduced a serious amount. After fully completing origins I decided to give it a go again.
New update is garbage. An excellent team is a poor team speed wise now. Keeps having errors and getting booted off. Fix before the new madden comes out or I won't play the new one . Fed up
Issues when entering post code I am unable to enter a full post code. Once I have entered the first part of the postcode e.g NN8 then both the letters and the numbers are greyed out and won't let me select them to enter the rest of the postcode
Cant join any online Cant join any online games with my gameloft live account but when I sign in with Google plus I find one right away pls fix all my data is on gl account

BOOOOOOO It don't do anything it won't make a sound and it takes tooooooo long to the voices
It does not make sense The graphics and the game on its own has problems
It bad Boo it's bad
Good, but... The game looks pretty good but it lags a lot and crashes frequently. I can only play one round before it crashes, I have to keep restarting the game. New obstacles are sometimes confusing and result in unfair deaths.
Latest update This is the 2nd update I've done and expected new levels on full  version and  theres nothing. Used up phone data for nothing. Please fix...
No bonus spins Why are the games so tight. I hardly ever get bonus spins anymore. ..why
Okay but needed more No zoom, cant draw and fill colors on it. Sketching is very slow. Line appears after I draw it
Still unable to get pastthe initial screen  Huawei phones don't seem to have the luck of being able to run this game yet, as i still crash out right after the initial sign in screen 
Horrible app stuck in the 90's Reminds me of Windows ME. No NFC or mobile payment or recharge of cards. Basically just duplicates the info on the website. Bus tracker inaccurate, and thus useless. The shitty website is better.
Unistalled My phone restarted and became unusable after installing the new update. Had to hard reset and a lot of pain. My phone is motox 1st gen.
CAN'T FOLLOW ANYONE. This is ridiculous as hell. I can't follow people or even post publicly on my own profile because everything is always glitched. I like google, but this is just now starting to tick me off. FIX THIS BUG.. the update did nothing
I hate this It gives you wrong answers this sht its helpful but when it comes to correct answers dont download this coz you will wasting your time
Need more instruments without paying Only one Instrument on the free app.
So many ads Constant interruption from ads, some if which are videos with audio that you can't skip. Constantly nagging to rate or invite friends. Not worth it
Like the game, best golf game out there. But almost impossible to get new gear with spending real cash. And as of the last update I now get a 30 second advert before each round. Will probably lead to uninstall.
Great concept but Technically very bad app,it never updates location,it shows a message relocating successfully but always shows wrong locations of family. Resolve it and get 5 stars.
Took everything I broke my other phone and had to replace and had over 40k points and lost all of it
Does not Chromecast or Google Cast Does not Chromecast or Google Cast. The TV will display the Slingplayer logo and connecting, but screen turns black. No audio or video.

Hate it forever... Wow I try to wake them with money but rlly still sleeping... u only get five pets I think the best ones are locked and just wow........ can't believe this..
The basic app works great but I bought an add on and now it wont let me unfollow anyone from the app. I have to hunt them down on instagram to do it. Which wouldnt normally bug me but i paid for extra feature and now the basic doesnt work. Fix it.
Ok At first its fun. After a while it gets really boring. I wish I can have a refund I spent like 10 bucks on money and 3 bucks on the game. Honestly if you have a busy life don't buy this it gets boring. And a waste of money
no cheats like other sims OUTRAGES seriously we need a cheat code mode and at least have like saved files my old d.s. is better than this freaking game.....maybe till they add it I'm keeping it at a 2 rating it's not worth my time
Nexus 6 broken  Immediately closes on startup Unsure if this is model specific or android 5.0.  My daughter loves this app. 5 star otherwise.
Could be great Doesn't offer full episodes and every interface of application is very limited. Uninstalled application.
Used to love it but now the auto Playlist is stuck. No way to pick videos. Please fix this

bad game ever fix it asap until this game looks like fifa .
Paying for other book I bought this and then paid for an additional ABCs book. So far it's been downloading for over 15 minutes. AVOID THIS APP.  Editors choice my A. It's obviously unattended. No network issues on my end just garbage on their end.
Fatal issue on nexus 10 On my nexus 10 the game screen shrinks to 14 size when I move a piece to the bottom of the screen. The game still runs. But placing pieces is difficult from then on.

It sucks Dont get this app unless you want a phony lazer. It doesnt actually shoot lazers out of your phone. DO NOT GET IT
The app stops working  Since the new update the app would throw me out and display the 9gag has stopped working.Rather frustrating really as the apps rather good.Please fix.
This game is disgusting please stay away Very bad
It's not good When I give my email ID it says its not correct
Pointless This app is terrible. If your child does not ALREADY know how to spell, you'll have to help them with this. A LOT.
I really liked the game Usually doesn't load and when it does it seems as if it waits for you to have a bingo and kicks you out or it lets you pay for card  and kicks you out keeping your tokens to play I uninstalled it.

Never works when you need it. And shows you doing few miles per hour when you not moving.
JUNK HOW DO PEOPLE GET TRILLIONS
Doesn't work Installed app,  tried to use it,  could find me but couldn't find the address. So the request taxi button never lit up. App is useless.
Not fast enough Very frustrating. When I open the app it takes forever before I can actually Shazam a song Ever since the new update when the stupid welcome screen appeared, it takes forever. So annoying
Not fun at all You should charge people for this app that way we'd know the only way to play is if you pay, you buy coins, because you give little to nothing at all. I can't afford to buy coins , so I'll just uninstall this app. Bye
Bakwasssss Too many ads piping up in between controls are not smooth as well. Wasted data on this crap
Got the app for my Colorado ltz storm can't create an account can't do anything... HOLDEN go with google maps or something

Maintenance 2 hours ago, it says that it will be ready in 2 hours' time. How many 2 hours do you exactly mean Stupid app
Rubbish. Doesn't alert you to any speed cameras, fixed or hidden. Waste of money.
Still waiting for proper file browsing File browsing is terrible and the app doesn't appear as an option to open files with when used from a better browser. Unusable for locally stored video libraries of any decent size.
   
Hey, i am disappointed.  I don't play as a professional nor as a gamer.  Still at my level your game sucks. Now i would like to know why you are not responding. ......
This is just bullshit Don't bother yourself downloading it coz it really sucks
Won't open at all for me since the update. I'm a long time user and use this app everyday. Very disappointed. Please fix soon.
Paid advertising Why have me pay then still plug the hell out of your own pages by hiding within tags. You should pay ME to advertise Stick with free version. No difference.
To many gems Everything at the end has to be unlocked with gems..... not worth the down load. 1 star....
I win tournaments and don't receive anything...very disappointing. This happen too many times.
Horsegirl13 This game only goes to level 8 and it goes by so fast so you don't have that much to play....if you fix it and add levels I will add more stars
Crap Developers should be ashamed with what they did to this game. Used to be a good game.
Does not work
Too easy Wasn't a challenge and the amount of times it crashed wasn't funny
Really liked the game but now it won't open on my phone tryed reinstalling it a few times but still nothing which only sucks where it's not a free game fix and rating goes back up 
This app doesn't work every time I dial a number it keeps shuttiing down. Big deception
Kak Ads in a loadshedding schedule Are you serious Like loadshedding isn't bad enough.
Worst app ever Wouldnt accept password to deactivate. Now it doesnt want to install
Controller Great game but a little hard without the ability to use a controller. The game doesn't load if I have a ps4 control connected
Hate Won't even load I have a Samsung s6 edge and once it finally loads when I open it it closed out right after not even making it so I can open the page ridiculous had foe years on my iPhone and worked perfectly .
I don't   like it There are no monsters like in the real minecraft and also like in real minecraft you can't even save ALL your hard work. Whoever created this game please make SOME changes  to  it.
Beautiful. Hands down the most amazing looking of all the sky apps. However it's not very accurate when it comes to reading my phone's sensors.  I can't figure out how to customize anything, there don't appear to be many options or settings
How do i get a refund PLEASE Only plays for a little bit then its stop casting to my smart tv... i wanna know how to get a refund... horrible... rip off
It doesn't work in restricted profile in lollipop It doesn't work at all in restricted profile in lollipop, can not take advantage on restricted users feature for my 3 yo girl
Update sucks Do a better job... it is laggy, and what happened to having outs in a home run Derby Time goes too fast, and I am losing to a computer.. come on now. 5 stars when you fix.
Nice to have but doesn't always work well
Look elsewhere Inept developers, it's a library of cards for christ sake, how dumb are you guys  Maybe I'll check back in a year to see if they've figured out which one is the hole in the ground and fixed this train wreck.
Nevwr opens
Boring Not good.
Doesn't Work HTC ONE8 I have not been able to finish a game, uninstall and reinstall made it worse. Freezes every time. I want my money back, don't waste your money Complete fail Sony.
Don't waste your time This game is not good. Players minimum bet lost all my coins with in 5 minutes
Why it always says  i got 0 score for every quize i took.kuck this app,
Not much to do here.
Useless App keeps on force closing. Until i on my wifi. Your GPS trackers are worst. The cab drivers always got my location wrong. And you always got bad drivers. Improve yourself. Or you gonna face what you have done..
Dude, what is its purpose besides rejecting you I mean, come on It did ''Access Denied'' THE HECK Its called a ''Fingerprint Lock'' not ''Reject Every Fingerprint''. Fix this to where it scans your fingerprint and set it as a lock for your phone.
Wat happened to the money spent I paid to unlock all and was able to play it till recently. Do u mean there is expiry for the paid app Are u able to rectify
RIPOFF  DO NOT BUY Completed in 3 mins. NEVER ever will buy anything from those scammers again.
Stopped working It was working fine last night and now it won't work. I just get a no media message. If this doesn't get fixed I want a refund. Total waste to only be able to use it a few weeks.
Paid for app with adverts Would be a 5 star rating if it wasn't for the in game adverts If I've paid for the game, I would expect there to be no adverts.
Laura Why do I only get to select a few teams  ,don't like this setup
Cant do wnload the game
 Not all the cars are available, and it keeps showing a error with the qr code
Want to like it, but... It's sluggish, slow to start. And, this is a matter of taste, the icon is butt ugly

Just a bad clone Annoying music, controls are clunky, don't understand onscreen prompts, very annoying music. Might be better if you could somehow connect a joystick but that's not the vendor's fault.
Doesn't work galaxy kids tablet. I hear the music but the screen is just black.
The adds are so annoying,  and often force stopped. Please fix it.
Useless app... It always points north towards the top of the phone... Whichever direction you are into...
No payout for big win Hit the Big Win should have had 2500 coins but only got 30.... Happend twice so will probably uninstalled. . Kinda takes the fun away 
Same bug appears on Sony Xperia SP as josephw390 has on S4. Only first launch has visible mark, any other try is invisible until complete clear data and of course any progress lost.

Love the game, BUT, can no longer purchase new categories with coins since updating to paid version, tried emailing got no help same with the help center. Please address this
Can't Text. Can't text on droid, and can't open all of the faces on the paid app.  Great when it works, but often it doesn't work.

There is no games What is there to play with the new game that I just downloaded has no games and I like apps that have a great game of the stuff that the company may put in the game and this app has been a way worse game then the other games
Update  Customer service. This game needs more teams. Beating the same 3 teams over and over again is becoming boring. Plus the customer service in all of Cartoon Network's games are terrible. This can easily be changed.
Galib Not bad

No scorecard or ability to add Gps seemed to work well but even though it had the course it did not have the scorecard or even the ability to add it so it wasn't very useful for using during the round.
Don't down load it Its a boring game and the screen is so little that you can't even see what you're doing.
Paid app So I bought the game yet if I want to advance to the third season without having to complete the first two I need to pay again I changed phones, so I need to complete everything again What did I pay for if I still get ads
Connection Problem I can't ever play the game cause theirs a connection problem

Don't download.   The game can't open. The first page is repeating and not open to play.
Ads Can't play one level without a add popping up before it starts or before it finishes. Rather play the fake CTR games and sacrifice the originality then play this. DON'T BOTHER GUYS, IT WON'T BE FUN.
Useless Useless game I have ever seen Just wastage of Internet Data And Time.
Months of waiting After months of playing, still no quest for stone. Maybe this is an option for paying customers I'm tired of logging in just to do the same thing everyday.
Well Son loves this game but once purchased it won't load. Please fix

Ads and IAPs Full screen pop up ads right after starting app, and requests for in app payments on the main game selection screen. This is not suitable for children.
Horrible Slow. Horrible interfaces. Bus tracker is inefficient and slow. Nothing makes sense and it looks like crap. The only good this are the gautrain notifications.

Boring. Do not installed this app. It takes long time to start.
Not good Why do I  need a premium subscription if it is free on ios
Worst game ever There was nothing to do in the game. There was 1 ugly girl to use, a few objects that were hideous and you had to pay for all the good stuff. So just to be clear , this is the worst game ever 
Des crotte des cochon N'est pas disponible dans tous les pays

wrong its daft, you gentle tap your ball and it say foul like a stuborn five year old.
Kooky. Looks great, but no substance, nothing works properly. Considering the money surfing is generating, a half assed, glitchy app is unacceptable, lucky for FOXTEL.  Lame effort, I'm going surfing instead.

Too many ads Ridiculous amount of ads to close before you even begin to play...
Doesn't work Did not even let create an account
Dreadful waste of 2 pounds Frustratingly difficult. Most of the time the game simply doesn't provide you with the tools you need to defeat the current enemy, and tiles are mostly scattered uselessly across the board.  Not that much fun.
I don't like this newer version at all. The power ups don't work like they used to. The freeze power up turns itself on before I want to use it. I want the old version back Newer version
No Moga support Unlike Sega's other titles, the Moga controller isn't supported in this game so gets 2 out of 5.  You'll get a 5 star review once you add Moga controller support.
Was good once upon a time. Was going great loved the game. But one I got so far the game stops. It says unfortunately it quit working. Then it made me restart the game, so I gave it another shot. And.... it stops working again Please fix.
It sucks I hate this game you start off with nothing and you have to beat the hatdest guys in the game while you have the weakest so i say it sucks 
Borring I completed it in less than an hour and you could drive through the cars.
The video to lure you in showed 3rd person battles. But the actual game fell woefully short. Not my cup of tea these types of game.

Doesn't work Doesn't even open on my Nexus 6. Emailed developers and got no response.
Good game, but ridiculous overpriced in game content This game is pretty good,  but it's ridiculous how overpriced an extra hero can be, costing upwards of 15 and it's  just a little hero and no extra content.
King of zombie Not so fun dis game..jus for kid level..my level is so far from dis level..please improve your game make more higher level like me have fun with dis game.not just simple make money k,dont be selfish person..
Bad Just so bad
Won't even let me play The screen freezes on the first search and won't let me push anything. Would be a great game if fixed.
No goals This app was what I thought I wanted , but no way to make goals . Pointless for me , back SHealth I guess . Don't buy this if you want to easily make goals .
Still the biggest donkey site I've been on If you like donkey poker, this is your site

Bootloop It keeps restarting itself over and over in every 5 seconds. Horrible
Ads are obnoxious I played this all week and loved it Today these obnoxious ads with annoying music started popping up when I finish a game. Most annoying ads I ever had on an app. Uninstalling....
Cheats Cute game, but something about when I reached a certain level, I couldn't get through it without power ups,.and even that didn't help  Done.
Won't go past test protocol 3 nothing happens Cant get any info on car at all as won't connect
Not like the site at all My favorite game to play on Sporcle is the trivia bingo, and either I just cannot find it for the life of me or it just isn't included. Bingo was the only reason I purchased this app.
Not working Always saying waiting for reliable signal,till now it doesn't show speed
This is the worst This thing always loads and it never hurrys up
Too many ads close to the game Dont want ads sitting ontop of game. Distracting. Deleted
Was a good game up until this new update. Now its keepa telling me to check my connection everytime i hit play so now this is a useless app

C'est triste parce que je voulais regarder des missions de tlvision franais, que je manque, mais apparemment je ne puisse pas regarder en angleterre.                           C'est dommage. . .

Turma da Galinha Tambm adquiri os 3 anteriores, em portugus, comprados e foram substitudos por esse em ingls com uma msica. Espero que o erro seja corrigido o quanto antes.
Search location having problem. Totally out. Local country but comes out world map. Data wrong, search Universiti Putra, becomes Universiti Malaya location. Can make a person unfamiliar get lost. Data integrity source

SUCKS After the update it won't open. Automatically goes to app store.
Boooooooooring n fake.... actually I saw everyones reviews for this app...guys dnt take it serious its just a prank
Too hard too quick Stupidly hard very quickly. The easy junior version of this game is stupidly easy....no middle ground here. Annoying. Had a few months, fed up with it, uninstalling. Theres only a few levels of challenging fun.
PAYOUTS ARE NOT WHAT THEY INTEND... I've noticed that when I hit a certain amount, it doesn't payout the correct amount.  That's no fun
I just purchased the full version everytime I hit the home button it tells me 24 hour trial period will end. And I have to click the Open button every time to go home what is up with this

Fun game but doesn't save progress I worked so hard to create an awesome world but I had to leave the game and 5 MINUTES LATER EVERYTHING WAS GONE. but still a fun game
Confusing categories Some artists don't really belong to one hit wonders.
Sucks Waste of my time and money. I used to play this game back when I was younger on my ps3. When this came out, I thought I would like it like when I was a kid. Now I can't just get the same vibe out of it.
Accuracy Accuracy has fallen through the floor in the last few years. Useless for anything but the weather radar.
Fix The doc station needs to be translucent. It's white.
Used to be a good game. Now it lags on some of the fastest wifis out there. Used to be a decent game and would have said it to be a 6 star. That was 2 months ago and now i can barly play it because of the lag.
No save level option Cant continue playing the first level each time I start the game when there are 100  levels.
This sucks It won't work when I go to put my scoop in it closes out
Won't work with Chromecast Press releases online say it now works with Chromecast.  No dice for me but all other apps cast perfectly.  What gives Sling  15 for false promises  I understand the pressure to roll put support but it'd best be ready
Bad Is baddddddd

Ok but not so good Adds come in every round and it disturbs us

Spider solitaire No training on how to play
Doesn't deserve 4 stars I was suckered into buying just to try, and it's disappointing. It's like candy crush for dudes or something. It's only saving grace is no permissions. Save your money.

Won't log in Even after quadruple checking the username password combination was correct.
Disgusts me.. How I paid for this app, and when I post to facebook, this app puts an advertising link in the memory of my phone. This is the PAID version. Tacky as hell.
Hated it This is so not funny It never made me laugh once. Invited twenty friends over that can laugh VERY easily but no one even smiled..... it deserves 0 stars

Greed A paid game should not have in app purchases or ads.

Why buy the paid version Why am I getting ads in an app that I paid for Maybe all of the buyers who feel cheated by having ads should get together for a class action lawsuit.
Doesn't open I haven't been able to open it for 3 days now
Bekar h mere facebook add krne wale paise chle gye aur app download price much ni mila
Advertising blocks top half of table so you can't even see where your shooting  Just trying to force you to pay for the upgrade
Repeated words Same words that keep repeating. Gets boring quick. Elementary level.
Very frustrated I used to play and loved it, I recently downloaded again and I am getting the loading screen, but a dialog box pops up with the following.. Marmalade v6.0.6 323198 Then the game freezes
Like the game, but WAY to many pop up ads, they pop up so quickly, that before you know it you have already tapped and opened the ad

Wheel of Fun It's not fun it's lazy
Needs Android 4.3 With the latest update, Android 4.3 or higher is needed, which is not available for the Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini in South Africa. As a result, I can no longer use the app. Epic fail, Discovery Insure.
Game deletion So, I loved this game. Yet, it failed me. The engine crashed on my phone, and forced a reinstall. Upon reinstalling.. All saved data was deleted. Royally irritating me
Doesn't Work
Different.... I am not happy. I used to be able to do anything on the people's teeth and you could pick the people. I remember this app and I used to love it... Now it's the stupidest game I have ever played... I'm very disappointed.
Pain in the train The app keeps opening, repeatedly, when it's fully closed and I'm not using it. I only use my oyster card about once every 3 months so the almost daily, multiple self opening is a real pain
Only one train My son loves this game, however it only let's you play as one train and is hard to navigate.
The new update I can't read anymore manga. I feel like I'm going to Uninstall this app and get another one. Waste of my time
More machetes We need more machetes to get ahead. Now we get 1 machete per level. And why do we have to install stupid apps to earn more Why can't we just watch videos to earn them

Push notifications. I turned off all of the push notifications, they still happen. I don't want to be constantly bombarded with this crap.
Crashes frequently This game crashes on my phone a lot, and at random points in the game. Sometimes the last turn, sometimes mid game. It'd be a great way to play Small World of the game didn't force quit more often than not.
Someone messed up  4 hour bonus is the only thing that kept this game playable  Unless you are into spending real money to lose fake money by the truck load . Now that's gone .Which means pointless to keep game . Aside from that it's stellar
Updates make this too laggy to use Recent updates to this game have rendered game play impossible. Should this not be resolved with the next update,  I shall have to uninstall it.

It won't load past the first screen.
Annoying notifications This app sends annoying notifications even if you turn them off in the settings. Fix the sound issues in the individual slots. Also, what happened to the lobby music

Not working This app does not work, at the moment it's telling me North is South West. 
It is a gyp. You get only ONE instrument. One, that is all. The other instruments you have to pay for. Not worth it, especially since the title says instruments implying more than one instrument is accessible.
If you pay, ads still pop up Come on, if you cough up 10 for an app you shouldn't continue to be bombarded with ads for other apps, especially not when the device is going to be in the hands of curious children. Please change this.

The game is great, but with the recent graphical update it has become unplayable for me. The tiles are barely readable and the background is a mess. Would give five stars, but two is the best I can do now.

More about advertising than gaming This shitbag of a driving game is an embarrassment but dare I say, par for the course these days. Wadding through 68 ads before even a hint of driving was a downer too. Avoid, unless into self flagellation.

Please give me my money back the game dosint work It Start's and then the screen just goes black
Terrible This app takes up a lot of internal memory,  which would be understandable... if it worked The app took about 30 minutes to download and after all of that time it won't  even open Very disappointed,  particularly after paying for it...
Good Nice
My pari2yrslike this types apps.
Solitaire Had trouble loading ,freezing
I have uninstaller and reinstalled and still saying installing.   Please fix this and will get higher ratings.
Issue When I block some caller,same caller calls again....App block call....its fine.But it changes my phone profile from genereal to silent.What should I do
Um...... I like just that it only goes up to level 8. Please fix. If fixed I will rate 5 stars
No more screen cast The last update sucks Before i was able to cast my phone's screen to the tv with just a few clicks... Now i dont even know how to do this anymore or if this is even possible....
Keep asking me to upgrade premium
Please FIX The only game I can play is the first one because the second and third one's close this is ridiculous fix or I'm reporting
No career mode with manager ability Where is the career mode with management part  That's what made me buy the game. Not to drive around some dumb tractors
Too many glitches Kid loves it but it constantly stops working. Cannot play it for 5 minutes without it unexpectedly stopped working. Also the music still plays when app is closed out. Have to restart my phone to get it to stop. Save your 1.99.
Not workin After the update still not werkin..  It used to be working pretty well... but not anymore
It will not stop freezing
Alexander This app is so easy to use  and it gives u  lyrics so u can sing along.
It won't let me play When ever I click on the picture I want to play it says please wait app is loading and then it closes it can you take care of that problem please
Its ok I would be more fun if it wasn't 5.99 Maybe drop the price on its you made a big profit on it already maybe try 4.99.
I cant login...its showing something is not right....please solve the issue
It is not working
Was super excited I'm not sure what's going on, not a single rom I've downloaded yet seems recognizable to this emulator as none appear in the games list. If I can't get it to work by tomorrow I'm asking for a refund.
Nexus Player Support I am not able to click anything to be able to play.
Was great, now has problems When subverting challenges you it breaks into the middle of your gabe to tell you Caused me to be kicked out of the tournament and unable to get back in
Ruined The last update has left the app unusable. Nothing loads now. Was working like a charm prior to the update. 
I hate this game Don't  play this  game
Not funny
Adsssss.. I hate to pop ads this game suuuuuckkkkkkkkksssss...
Horrible Don't ever pay this game because it doesn't have so many opened
doesn't bring out a clear outcome as i expected.very borrying
Unit t Converter plus This app is poor. For example the only currency conversation rate available is from the selected currency to USD. It's not possible to go straight from EUR to GBP. It's useless.
Hated Not so cool game it won't work too
Good
Not a fair game I played this morning an the other player wouldn't play hacked the game an WON . the next game the player didn't play, it froze, then said HaHa smhhh he WON that's why I rate this game 1 y'all need to fix this problem ASAP
Ads Nice little unity game but I won't tolerate unskipable video ads. Uninstalled.
Dog Pish
Poor Easily bested by Google maps
Could be better Cant connect pokemon blue or red with pokemon yellow this is a big problem the only reason i got the app....its now a waste of time highly disappointed i expected better from this app how sad and pathetic
Verification code not sent....
DOES NOT WORK
It's OK could of had better deals and upgrades Who the heck would say I would love to kill kids Pryce Kelly yayou
Worst AI ever Wish I didnt waste my money on this app. At first seems cool but as you get deep into game it starts handicapping you against the main character Tenniel. Game starts doing crappy things to make sure computer beats you.
Ok but after a while it is not allowing me to make anymore
Cant have my 4 year old play it cause of the pop up adds coming up every single minute.. ridiculous. Gonna uninstal it
Can't stop easily Ok, but I can't stop it Mostly stupid graphics, could be so much better. Kind of a waste of money in my opinion.
Lamia yes I can try again yes ok Dbhefb fhx
I like it Samsung galaxy grand  2
Fake, Iam on pace maker 60 pmin.this app. Shows 72p m.totaly fake .
Constant freezing When the app works, it's great. But it only works for 3 minutes before freezing on both smart phone and Kindle Fire. So it's completely unusable.
Update stinks Why change to squares the rounded corners weren't as distracting.   Why take away the round  outstanding games notification   and why the giant sections. The old game was better. This one is offensive to look at.
Jams up phone Ever since new update,  every time i reset my phone this particular app needs to update, And i reset my phone everyday.   Screen stays stuck  calls cannot be answered.  Thanks but refunds should be in order.
Terrible app  For a paid app it desperately needs a design refresh to follow Android Design Guidelines. It feels sluggish and unintuitive to use. The auto locate feature often doesn't work and just says Auckland.
Profit over playability It's too farmville. You're constantly out of a supply that you can conveniently buy for 5. I'm on a search for a game like civilization. This isn't it.
Glitchy Does not play anything like the board game. Single player campaign often marks you as failed despite fulfilling all the requirements. Feels unfinished.
Says need internet connection I love the game but I am tired of it saying I need a internet connection when I have a internet connection and the problem is getting worse you need to fix them I will change my rating
I noticed that as soon as you read it the winnings stop Yes as soon as you're ready then the winnings really decrease be careful
Needs a lot of work. Get logged out during a match and you lose all your progress. Login screen glitchy, rarely works. Board and pieces way to small. Will someone please make a better stratego game already 
Stopped working after last update Stopped working after last update. On sony xperia z tab. Please fix asap
Went from best to worst Customer service sucks. I sent 5 emails and they never replied to any for the help I needed.
Opening it When I installed it and then I clicked on it but it opened and then went back to the home screen and I saw somebody say that they had a samsung galaxy 3 and the spring unsprung version didn't work on their phone

I  liked  this  game This game was very nonsense game and it will hang your phone

I go in for this I go in and every time i try it says Game Wizard has stopped PLZ FIX OR I WILL REPORT AGAIN
Crap My three figures showed three results. Too much adds. Annoying. Waste of time
Its crashing... Evrytime I click on tap to start button, it takes me back to my mobile home screen and game gets close..
Annoying Ad Great game besides the annoying Sprint Ad which forces me to open my browser, force close the webpage, and the restart the game happens every two to three levels or so. Will fix rating when ad is removed or fixed.
No multi player I have tried to connect to a game for 2 days and have had no success what so ever. Great game but I will uninstall if this connection issue continues
Can't use It down loaded upside down. Even after I turned off auto rotate it still  shows upside down
Stupid app Why you have to exclude other packages..we all pay DStv.
Used to work Doesn't work
Fking sht Levels are repeated 23 times. Very poor graphics. Pls don't download.
List empty Suddenly there is no schedules anymore it says list empty

Poor controls Game is not easy to control. Mickey Mouse game designed for kids 10 who no longer watch Mickey Mouse

Bakavas Don't waste your time in this application.

Won't disable notifications Despite me trying repeatedly to stop notifications of the current test match, the app alerts me EVERY WICKET. Make it stop.
One word LAG Random deaths won't let u move sometimes random jump lag surprise traps that pop up at the last second.
Wtf I mean you do not learn any thing from the musical world all you do os play around until your desperate heart continents
Ok When I'm playing 3 on 3 battle on hard the control lags your block don't block you dash lags .

It's not working the app I am opened and login the app it's still loading I have checked 30minutes it's still loading app waste application. I have screen shots for this app loading images how to share these screen shot images.
Don't download this game it is not nice and by downloading this your time will not save
I dont like this game. Impossible stage is forever impossible because there is no levelup system, items, and any other remedies. Moreover repetition of the same work is tedious.
It sucks ballz
LOL JOKE Don't install guyz its a waste of time and net .

Can't log in Can log in on desktop but not on mobile. I use a password manager to automatically fill the password so it isn't a typo. I suspect the mobile app doesn't handle special characters correctly.
It worked once I bought the app and now it has become unusable. Video are un viewable no matter what bitrate or resolution. I give up.

Sucks The game keeps not loading.  It upsets my kid beyond measure. After paying for the game it should work.
Where do I start It isn't a terrible game, but my main complaint is you can't swap bubbles. Fix that and 5 stars
Needs more room Needs expansions. There's not  nearly enough room to put things. And only have six garden spaces when most of the ingredients to make things need four. The game should progress as you go. This dosent

Not for use in the USA This app is only for vehicles in India, not for use on USA license plates.
Terrible grammar You can barely understand what it's saying...

Memory Training No menu to choose to turn off sounds. No menu to read directions. Immediately uninstalled.

Haven't been able to complete a game Seems to consistently lock up every couple turns. Sometimes when it does it leaves screen artifacts behind and the only way to fix is to reboot   wish this game would work, love the board game.

The time on this widget is not auto update to get compatible with the phone time, I have to press on the  time area to update..
Kinda boring At first it was really fun, but then it got very boring, very fast. I thought it would be fun but I dont recommend this game unless your favorite thing is easy strategy.
Now with Ads  Because my toddler is really interested in speeding up my phone or fighting dragons Now he opens up google play when painting  Uninstalled.
No good on LG G3 after update to Android 5.0 This was a fun and addictive game until the update. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling but it still looked funky. Very bummed.

Solitare Why would anyone want to play this game with the stupid damned ads popping up in your face after every deal No thanks

Great game BUT... Ads every time I open the menu and before I even get to play That's just ridiculous
Dumb When I die some stupid advertisement has to come up out of nowhere
Terrible Won't even let me play anymore
Good Game But ads for a game that costs money Ridiculous
I loved this game until I realized how this game does not payout.  It is the lamest slot game ever  Play this slot if you want to lose all of your money.

ball Yeah is amazing
bad
Grown up section won't open What good is this app if i cannot open what I purchased Ridiculous
To much advertising and hang a lot How can any one play this game with unstoppable covering screen adds side adds and it also hangs to much stick cricket is far far better than this .
Team play only NEW RENEWED DISLIKE NOT CORRECTED I really wish you could choose team or individual play. Very hard to rate game when FORCED to play a version you don't favor.

So dumb
Hate The game sucks you will never unlock new levels
Great Game  Horrible Lagging I love this game, but unfortunately the lagging and glitches are too irritating to keep on my tablet...  if they ever fixed this I'd definitely redownload it  play again
I can't even download the game I get to 90 then it finishes and I have to redownload it. Waste of money.
It made no sens
Critical bug Sometimes the game throws different questions to the opponents, so it doesn't make sense to compete anymore. I paid money for full version and now regret it. Devs aren't doing anything about it I want a refund
App version is 2.5 and i hided  images only. Like wallpapers, WhatsApp profile pics, share it app images etc
WHAT I downloaded it and it said could not find obb data.Like what the hell m8

Glitch I put one X down and I don't wait for him to do it because I accidentlly put it in a wrong place and click new and he goes twice or he goes three times and hee wins
Fix scanner please Everytime i try to take a pic of a card the sets wont download. Then i get an error message. Will five 5 stars when it works again
Actually love it but.. The game always freezes and the buttons to navigate the game doesn't work. Click one button to play and takes you to another screen. Galaxy Note 4.
Suck
Can't upgrade after already paid for I played and upgraded this game on my old phone, downloaded on my new phone and even though it says I already paid for it.... I can't upgrade. Almost feel like demanding a refund
Wrong songs The anthem you have for the UK is actually My Country Tis Of The from the US and the Star Spangled Banner seems to be a half an octave to a full octave off in some places

something's wrong with the app today. unable to load earlier tweets in lists. the load more doesn't load at all. please check and fix asap.
I did reinstall app But it still runs ridiculously slow. It takes the fun out of the game when you have to wait a minute between questions. Sometimes when it's time for akinator to guess, game just keeps processing forever. Disappointing.
Give me my money back I've played this game once. I've tried to play it about 10 times but I can only get so far before it force closes. Unacceptable for a paid game
Horrible Won't let me play as guest and there's no option to sign up. Went to website, signed up, then tried signing into game. Still didn't work.  Going to uninstall right now.
No rate One star is enough
Sucks Doesn't start. It's restarting every time i accessed the app
DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME LIKE I DID Took ages to download.... and after all that it won't connect to its own server and just says waiting to load assets then after about 5 minutes it decides to crash.

Block text Function disappeared after upgrade. Only block calls available.
Bad update No tables available. Says use the play now cube and that doesn't even work. Tables is lagging terribly. Game used to be fun and easy to play. Now it's more like a job just to play.

HTC Bug The needles rarely display.
MegaFreeze This game use to rock. I had to install and reinstall all day still no luck. I played first two dungeons and now I can't play. Should change name to when hell freezes over.
It's Terrible The graphics are terrible and you can't run the ball. When you get tackled it pushes you back 5 yards. If you want a good football app play Madden Mobile.

Destroyed the app The latest updates to Snapchat have made this app horrible. It drains battery, snaps keep failing to send even with perfect signal and it's just glitchy. Needs a big fix
Broken Randomly doesn't remove the letters you've selected from the bottom list and some of the puzzles are not solvable because they don't have the necessary letters to solve.
Shit I  using the same dam phone same dam Sim. But it keeps saying INVALID DEVICE ID... DO SOMETHING... How many times do i have to uninstall and install

Lazy port Wish i could get my money back, lazy port. Can't play without WiFi why it could have been done so much better Such a classic
awesome until So this game is great. Don't get me wrong. However, it keeps starting me back at level 79 when I start it, regardless of how far beyond it I advance. Not cool. Otherwise it's a good game, great way to pass some time.
Can't use my other mods I can no longer use my other mods it used to work but now it doesn't. Fix this and you get 5 stars
Very bad app only few states are given.
Classic game ruined by port Needs WiFi or data to play.   I got this game to play on my morning commute. But it appears I just wasted my money on a crippled single player player game that needs Internet to work.
Used to be great Was the best if not all that realistic cricket game but is now blocky, laggy, slow and freezes all the time, especially when the AI is about to bowl, making timing impossible. A great shame.
Game sucks. When you make a table for easy, fun play and you aren't a 'pro', you end up with a 'shark' as an opponent
Why                                                                every thing is locked exept the bracelets plus i had a few of crayola apps they were good but not amazing...so disapointed ... plz fix it

Doesn't save bikes to fb Does not save tournament bikes or single player stats to your Facebook account so when you reinstall on a new phone you lose everything. This is a great game, but I will not be reearning my 2 and 3 star bikes.
Give back the 1 touch move. You make it bad by add 2 touch to move. Feel not right
So so Only shows a handful of current buzzes then shows stuff that's over a year old, doesn't post pics at the best of times and is just down right annoying. Apart from those really annoying parts it's good for a laugh with crazy people

Poorly made The content iself is good, but the app has a terrible UI, and is easily the laggiest app I have used. Lag on a top of the line device like mine is completely unacceptable.

Lots of fun, but... Too many annoying bugs that prevent the game from playing. I'd be happy to submit screenshots andor explain the bugs, but there is no way to submit feedback through the game.

Bad When I play the game it does not even have the right letters. For example, discovery channel it had the y in the picture , but not in the letter section
H Keep on getting license check error every time I open the game. Would give a higher rating if this was fixed.

Poor performance Incredibly or performance on my Galaxy Note 4.also fails to go full screen status bar covers top of game.
Shenika Martin My two year old son loves this game
Little slow and buggy I've got the other Daniel game and it is OK. This one is a little slow and I have to figure out where it stores all the pictures and how to clean it up. About half the videos cause it to Force Close too.
This is a bomb I hate this game. Plz fix it. I will never ever and my whole life download tis game again

Very poor app. No kids,  no promotions, very limited character customizations, and crashes every few minutes.  Sucks.
Worse after updating The app is too lag after the new updates. Watch video does not work at all. Please do something about it.
In my opinion,this game comes pretty close to being the MOST HORRIBLE game EVER invented and VERY VERY SURPRISINGLY, Temple run 2 is WAY BETTER       
Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime After New Update It Has Been Freezing So Much  I Can't Press The Go Back Button Because All I Get Is  A Black Screen . I Have To Close Then Reopen Just To Continue To Play And I Love This App  Please Fix

Does not work on Android 5.1 Stay away from this if you're device is running Android 5.1 or higher, it does not load up. The developer failed to address this in the update.     Works on my other device that runs on Android 4.4.4
Problems. When I broadcast the chat on screen isn't in my own room. When I search for a hashtag broadcast it loads the first room only and won't let me choose who to watch.

Not working it is fack app
Fucking Usually i hate lies.. But this is so disgusting... Damide
I would not recommend this app because it has too many pop ups, too many advertisements and you can't read the story because of the pop ups Horrible app

Fun Games Ok
After payment download won't complete Either fix the bug or give me my money back. Download gets to 180 mb then I get an error everytime.

Wawa It does not work every time I log in I couldn't play it log out to my homescreen

Won't work This app used to work, now Wont eve. Load really annoying. Sort it out
Data Eater I been using this app and yesterday i found that it consumed my 500mb of data....how is it possible that a chatting app eat that much data 
About this game This game is very nice.
Can't access details of historic runs Crashes every time I try to go back and look at details of previous runs. Using Samsung s6
This game gets 5 stars but... I bought riptide 2 and was never able to download it. The credit card was charged but I can't get the game..bullcrap

Rip off I paid for some coins and never received them. So I emailed them, and still nothing. Not even a reply.
Very bad I'll give 2 starts because the program seems to be good but I cant even drag to play and it log me off at all time. Very terrible I was gonna pay the monthly payment for this app but I gonna go ahead and cancel it
Don't waste money It sucks every thing is bad and glitchy do not buy
I. Love.  It Kop
The worst of mobile gaming practices Incessant notifications, meaningless social integration requests, rampant inapp purchases. Simply having this game installed is far more annoying than any fun you'd have playing it.
Castle Wonders Hidden Object..Got rid of it IT kept freezing up. A real pain 
Love the moth, but the app is trash Crashes and hangs frequently  just about unusable a lot of the time.  Interface is confusing too.  Love the Moth, wish the app actually worked.
The app itself is not bad...but the font size keeps getting very small...and constant ads interrupting approx every 3 levels...to annoying
DO NOT DOWNLOAD ULESS YOU WANT TO PAY REAL MONEY It is AWFUL I Don't Think Anyone Should Get It It won't let you make a necklace, earings Or a head band Do Not Get
Bakwas Wanted to connect to Internet to play games of different types
Waste downloading not gud and its asking for purchase another game
Ok. Average Smooth, no issues. Not very exciting though, give me some more interesting tables please. Maybe better jackpot options would be good as it gets a little repetitive. Not bad though.
Bosan Permainan yg sangat bosan
SamandNick The game was way to short and there really wasn't a challenge.
 I am downloading this for an upcoming trip... I can't really rate the app before ever trying it, but the system insists I rate it Maybe I would give it a higher rating, if I was actually able to use it first
Doesn't work Doesn't work at all
samsang note3 It does not work I tried Panasonic and Tedelex so the problem is not my phone its this remote coz I have installed a decoderpvr remote and it works just fine.

Waste of time and money The city selection is the worst I have ever seen.  They do not even have Atlanta No cities within even 100 miles of me
This game scares me bc every time I play it, it has a code that says it's weird and scary. It says it cannot play due to this error.
Ok Don't waste your money just for this it glitches and doesn't let you turn when you move your finger don't buy it
Meh It only takes you like 3 days to complete the whole game and the story is so short but free roaming is the best. The cost is way too expensive and the story is ok. But I can't restore my save which Is bs
Location Where can i set my locations..  This is so unintuitive
No sound No sound.
Bad game When i must land safely, guide the mine, and close the door, i always win in the first time, but when second time i always lose. I will give you 5 star of you fix it
Not working It crashes just before i start a game and quits the game
Cool.....but It is an very cool game but you have to buy the rest of the game. You only get 2 dresses,and you can't put on an tale. Do not download it is an waist of time And if you do download it,you are making an VERY BIG mistake,I promise you 
No station The closest station to me is a 2 12 hour drive from where I live. Wish I could have done a search before paying for this. What a waste of money. I live right by the capital of my state too. Why do they not have a station
Chill If you know what the weather is then download it
Sucks royally It wouldn't even let it load for my daughter to play once. it kept shutting down on us. And at every turn possible there pop up ads.
Should be 5 stars Want more stages.... 
Not working I want this app to work but I can't get pass the start menu
Help I bought it yesterday an it wouldnt open, i have uninstalled it an reinstalled it. It still isnt opening
Can't export   so there's no meaning on art working... Please add the feature of exporting art work to standard format JPEG or PNG....... Then you can get 5 Stars. Without this feature this app has no value.
This does not teach anything This game had potential but as it is, it is no good. The tasks have no educational value
Unfortunately stopped Not at all opening in my Samsung galaxy note 3 ......... unfortunately stopped is displayed  by pressing on the icon of the app
 
Meh. Shoddy port.  No controller support.  Pressing home button causes game to restart.  Even the icons are low res
Garbage Lame low quality garbage.
Bad customer service, glitchy payment system While I enjoy the game somewhat, the payment system and glitches make this freemium game unreliable. If the game had tweaks here and there, it would be great.  Unfortunately,  the problems persist.
6 teams NOT I drafted 6 teams that's 6 leagues then when I want to add a player in league 3 it goes back to league 1 everytime fix this and I would love it if not back to cbs app I go
Very cool app but for some reason my phone keeps getting a black screen when I try coming back from sleep mode. Started happening after I installed this. Hope there is a fix.
Baccho ka video game.. plz dont b fooled..
Really seems cool, but... I'm stuck with the same elements and can't make anything else. I've tried all the combinations I have which are only 4 with their branch offs, and none of them create anything new. Sucks.
In starting it was ok..but at level 16 u can not complete d level due to different colors of balls. So i dont waste my tym on dis..nd i uninstall it..

Very bad Not cover titwala which 10km from kalyan on kasara route
Useless Can't change CPU beyond 200mhz and 1200mhz on my S2. Even when adding a custom text file, and I set it to overclocked numbers, it never goes past 1200. I can already do all this in the settings menu of the device. This app has no use.
Fake Not like other dating services.its more like a porn site.where u video chat with them.not worth it.if u look for real love.
Very bad Ya it's really slow and not so gud stories
Forum Won't allow me to put my favorite forum in,  and its not on the list,  only reason I downloaded it... Any support for this
Can't load image try later Just started playing and 2 slots that I opened after lvling won't download Why would I want to be stuck playing a low level slot Fix ur issues and I will change my rating, as for now I can't even play.
Really bad now Used Navfree loads with no problem. Now its 'upgraded' to Navmii it won't worked. Needed it few days ago when lost  crash n closed Just tried at home n same again. Not worth the memory usage
Terrible Everytime you do a time challenge, you can never get three bolts.

Worst game in this world This game Complete rubies, don't play this if you play this you lost your time
It charges automatically This app charges after using it for so long and I can't figure out how to cancel it
Mess Designed 4 computer 2 win 80 of d time
ESPN is terrible You are crazy If you think Bruce Jenner is courageous. A veteran who lost his legs and now has moved on and is accomplished is courageous. ESPN is a joke. Deleting this app.

Very very bad. Chutiya game.       Very very 3rd class game. Data loss  time loss. Not work even onj 4G. Very bad developer, not develop properly.
They don't let you make enough coins to get the bows ...they force you to spend money ....total rip off
Too slow and laggy Used to be great, but will be giving it a miss now as it's too slow.
Issue The app is good but tournament is not opening.. I tried to open tri nation tournament but after selecting one team as your team it does not go ahead..
Oh Can I like have my money back Its very laggy and the controls are pretty bad...
When I want to play a game it always freezes when it halfway done and this is why nobody else likes it I think I did not read all the comments

Edit course Mountain Crest,  Las vegas is my home course and the scoring needs to be edited. It be nice if we could edit the scoring.
Thieves Don't download Bought 15.00 worth of coins , never registered in my game, sure as hell took my money. You filthy thieves
Missing character Its really frustrating, after countless hours ive spent with this game my character suddenly disappeared. Fix this problem please.
Moron Every Game...and I do mean EVERY Someone gets the 64...55...6663...some money rock right off the rip Your game is BS and I call you on it
Gameplay is laggy. Too many laagy gameplay even in high end android device.works super smooth in Low end windows phone.fix issues fast.
Still doesn't work. Attempted fix, and I still am unable to retrieve my old save data.
Not very impressive Boring story and dull gameplay. Really wanted it to be better, but at this point, it's just not enjoyable.
          .        .    .     .         
Bootleg Fruit Ninja This game should be used as a punishment. Get ready for an arm workout. NOT FUN LAME I'd  give 5 stars for sucking if that were an option. Thank you and goodnight  Deleting
Espy Award Disgraceful... done with ESPN Uninstalled
Unbelieveable Since the game got the multiplayer online racing,.. The race are not fair enough,. The head start also are different within 5 second late.. The cost to repair the car also expensive.. Please improvise the unequality. 
If you run out of ammo and have no money You cant play the gsme no eay to earn money without missions and you need guns for that si kinda unplayable
Crap Can't list any cars due to there low mileage requirements...Un installed an deleted. Prices for cars are also higher than what budget charges.
Good game. Evilhorrible developer. Space hogger I'm sitting at 596mb with this in my storage I think it's due to the 1 million video ads downloaded. Also it crashes a shTload especially on startup. It's very heavy on resources.
Cannot Retrieve Seating Layout Brilliant app. But it's pointless if you cannot book tickets through it. I keep getting stuck at choosing seats. Fix this bug and I will rate it 5 stars.
How can you get your money back This game lags so bad that I can't even play it
So buggy, wonder how this app got through QA. Huge fan of TAL though. Will always look for updates and hope this matures.
Getting load icon...that's it
Does not work on HTC One M5 Purchased and always crashes after title screen. Waited to rate until a few updates still does not work.
Jams. Always Please do something about this. My samsung note 3 seems to ALWAYS jam on my 3 or 4 sortie. Please do not download unless you intend to get pissed real fast
Very Difficult to play it's very bad game bcz they can out you without any wrong move even you make a perfect shot.

Unable to use Downloaded for plane ride as it says it has offline capabilities. Would not open past the entry screen in airplane mode. galaxy S5.
Not much to it. Only two songs and explains nothing.
The game kept on bugging out before I could even do route 1 on Los Angeles. This game is poor to play on any Sony Xperia phones especially the E1 so I am uninstalling this AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I'm disappointed
Not teachable This teaches nothing if you press the wrong key it does it for you. please fix thx.
Great game n addicting . . . Please allow player to install or uninstall the vehicle upgrade.  Because sometimes maxed out  vehicle doesn't make it best on some area   stage . . .  Overall, Thanx

Kamruzzaman Manik
TERRIBLE The notes are not labeled right, and dont sound right
nice app easy to use work good
Trouble Brewing Either BR did an update or certain feeds have a 'pseudoadware' type of deal. A bubble offering 'trending apps' keeps appearing. Some clarification would be nice.
1 Rating Only I Like this game but after Thomas Played Other Engines can not Unlocked.. Or I have to buy it... If You can fix it then Only I Love to Play it.. Or I have many option for Game Playing...

Disappointed  There only a collection of YouTube videos to watch, which don't even work I could easily just go on YouTube and watch Mark Crilly without having to get the trouble of video's not working '
It lags It doesn't let me swipe over fix this and I'll give 5 stars but for now I wish I could give this a zero
      
Who made this  After paying for the updates and maps it now says I haven't. Money well spent there... not.  Avoid this app like the plague
Privacy issues. Prices of reports should be shown upfront before asking for personal details.
Koneksi tidak stabil... Buka manga server tdk ke deteksi, buka youtube lancar aj. Koneksi speed 2mb tidak bisa utk mmbuka komik 
Sucks I played this game for like three minutes and then it stops and it doesn't do that on my other games. I gave it one star so I could rate it, not because it deserves it.
Hate You are right Annabel aviles . I mean why is all the good stuff locked No one is stupid enough to pay that much money. I hate all tutotoons games that is why I have none
Crashes I purchased this app and click it to play it for my son, it goes black n back to my home screen, I tried reinstalling and it still crashes Have a very sad n confused 3 year old
It's okay. Barely gives me any likes Fix please.
Where is the BUY option Some people want everything free. I HATE Adds and would be happy to pay the asking price just to be rid of the endless commercials. Just let me buy your app.
Keeps crashingnexus 5 Won't work for my nexus its shut down every time I've tried to play the first mission
Men. Its OK.But I would like it more if I could get the other animals easier, or someone told me how to get them.
Doesn't work They say it's compatible with Verizon fios, which a big fat lie.

bakwas hai bil kul faltu muje english nahi aati hai so ye to bil kul faltu
One star only because I had to. I was super excited to try it on my new phone note 3 and all it does is force close . I haven't even seen the opening screen.  Fix it  I'll come back and check again soon  Getting rid of it again 
Bus tracker poor. Tracker doesn't update quickly, if at all. I advise you don't wait at home confidently using this as a guide. The map is also very slow. There had to be a better way...
Still waiting on bug fix It keeps crashing when i close after each time i play and i need to re install every time. This has been going on for literally over 3 MONTHS now. Not happy. Please fix
Can't find destination It says it can't find my home but I switched back to maps and it works fine,
Popup Ads The Game This movie trivia game is good enough, if you can handle the never ending popup ads for games.
Nice for my son
Are you kidding me I PAID  just to have this game take up tons of space on my phone. It does nothing but CRASH every five or so minutes  I can't believe that I didn't pay attention to user ratings PRIOR to buying this game.
Not as good as it looks Looks like a really good game but the graphics are terrible
Jungle castle run Boring boring boring The most exitement I've gotten from this game was reviewing it.
Boing It does not even work properly
Coco  dress Best game  ever
It keeps getting stuck on loading the activities, see all brings up just a load icon and if you go into choose and get all the way till it says an activity at the top after the make button it then just gets stuck loading again.
How How do you play this game
Won't let me slide When I  try to slide it just makes me go off of side I'm so deleting by his app but if fix that I will give u full rating
Doesn't work for me at all. Locates me just fine but it doesn't let me request a taxi and I live in the US. I signed up and tried again but still it didn't work.
Kotor No text shows up in any of my conversations. Makes it impossible to play without knowing how to answer. Fix it
Another good game thats spoiled by ridiculous in app purchases needed to progress. I know the developer needs to make money but this system is simply terrible.
Rubish U only get round 5 levels then u hav 2 pay 4 the rest. And its well expensive. I recomend Were's My Water 2. Its a lot better and u get all levels 4 free
Changing my review from 5 stars to 2 because latest update doesn't do anything except crash on open. I paid for a twitter app and now I haven't got one  will revert my review when it works again.
Amazing Game Too bad it crashes CONSTANTLY after each battle on my Xperia Z2.  I can't make it past the 3rd fight.  Thanks for wasting my time and money Square, I'll be certain to remember this before purchasing any future games.
Poor Gamebel
Really How does this app get such great reviews I pointed it directly at the moon and it gave me Jupiter
Hate it...only steal my money
Why you no add actual lazers I got this harry potter wand and I was like I should get this app and my wand would be like MAGIC it wasn't. I played non stop on the games to get the coins. I wasted my time. I wanted real freakin' lazers.
Programming mistakes It needs to improve more in programming so tht you will overcome some fatal mistakes in chess. I hade twice chackmate where was not, and I had two pieces of elements like queen at same time. So just hve a look on those aspects.
Rhythmic Game Nope. There was nothing rhtymic about it at all.
Fix Fieldrunners HD I payed for both of these apps and they are now unplayable. Screw it. Deleting both games....
This is my 3rd time Last time I had over 25 pearls 13,000 sand dollars, and over 10,000 algae rebooted my phone lost it all. This is the last time I'm doing this. I have paid for packages and I won't make that mistake again.
           
Too many adverts The numbers only go up to 10 and there are too many inappropriate adverts when using the back button to switch between game types. A good effort but needs improving
The game sucks no fun Every time I turn it does not turn right and when I lose control it is hard to get to control. In a tablet it is easy. Don't like the game.
Not worthing
Won't update paid version on Amazon Shucks you won't update the version I bought on Amazon.  Still at version 1.0
I want my money back I want a refund as soon as I got it it would not let me get a refund
This is a joke, I payed for this app and absolutely loved it, you guys did great... Until today's update... Whatever has been done needs to be fixed because it no longer works for anything, making it a waste of money. Ridiculous.
Doesn't work. Ad scam. Doesn't work with 2 yr old Samsung LCD TV. Ads show every time you change a screen in settings. Asks to rate before you even use the program. Terrible app. Wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy.
Add more stores
Good game for kids OkMalumNatis its pretty cool for kids
Doesn't work It's a total junk, always works for only 30 min or so and stops. Every time you take picture, it shuts down tracking, after picture taken, they can not be open in the app. Only pain, used to work long time ago, unreliable.
Stupid It's so anticlimantic you think there's going to be lights poping out of the camera but it doesn't stupid just stupid
Multiplayer Did Apple payed you to release Multiplayer only on IOS
Hated it So I'm looking for a nice app to keep my siblings off of I found this app and I try to scan my finger but all it says was access denied so please do not download this its a waste of time
Can't play An ad for train simulator pops up and I can't take it down. Havnt even gotten to the menu. Needs to be fixed
Very few states are involved.improvise ur database
So sad Love this game but it crashes after the ending of my first game. ..then in takes 30 min to hr before I can play again.  Hopefully gets fixed soon
Too many glitches Really REALLY wanted to like this game, but career mode is just filled with glitches. Gave it about 9 hours of play to really make up my mind, but It's not worth the money right now, just wish I could get a refund.
annoying new v2.1 is total rubbish always crashing... downgrading back to v.1
Not accurate Says today will be load shedding but there is nothing
Some stuff in there kinda sucked im a big fan of dubstep this kinda sucks good effort do lol
Cool app but...... I paid for pro how come you still watermark my photos I choose a custom logo but it does not show up..none of your samples show the watermark....FALSE ADVERTISING
It's not dot to dot It's not the game for me
Frustrated The game is good but most of the time it crashes and just gives a headache while playing multiplayer due to problem in network  or connection problems
I'm really upset... I just bought the whole pack since my son loved the free ones but was getting bored. The parent section worked until I downloaded the calls... Please fix or refund...ridiculous
Stupid I unstalled it and it still does not work
I like the emojis, but they dont work all the time...  never work on FB...
Ashtakkaste Beda
Takes your gold bars and coins when its daily bonuses i have contacted support and nothing ever happens
Full of ads New update shows apps almost always after pressing home button. REALLY annoying. And I stand by this. Everything is already turned off. But home button still gives sponsored ads. Too bad, I really loved this launcher.
Mock draft disability You can not go into your draft activity without the app crashing
Does not work This opens and closes what a waiste of money give it back to my google play account so I can just spend it on a game that will work yo honestly. 
Scam Just cant seem to win also you can't change your bets low enough to keep playing. Spin after spin I learned a long time ago never ever to by coins. I WILL NEVER SPEND A DIME TO PLAY ANY GAME AGAIN 
Improvements have to be done In this game there is no high score and any options in this.Its better to be improved.
Unhappy I purchased 3 of the Monkey Preschool games tonight for my son who loves the apps.... However they will not download to my Galaxy, I keep getting an error 491 message. Very unhappy at the waste of money and now I have a very upset 2 year old 
Garbage Won't let me turn on search history, can't find any of my saved searches thus making this app useless.

Can't pass mission I try my best still can't pass the first mission.
This app ruined my phone. I can't even back up an app it keeps typing passwords without me touching my phone. Don't buy this app and save your money because it is not worth it. I have the note 3 running on kitkat just fyi
Boys and girls 3d It  bad  games  I  have  too  tilt
Horrible AI No way in hell most games either me or my opponent will have the perfect bones to play. Uninstalled until AI is fixed.
No longer working.. error905 It is good, but it should be more like a dollar 99
App useless after latest update
DO NOT BUY slow with pictures, sometimes works with songs. Does not work at all with videos. No point wasting your time and money.
Won't work at all... Registered for an account and app tells me that 'may have entered an incorrect email address', even tried the forgot password link and to register an account again. Paid for an app i can't even log in to, let alone use
its fun but..... they want u 2 buy the levels n i dont want 2 please make this game BUT make it that u can pay spongbob money thats in the game
Junk Said I had free mins then while making call told me I needed more credits for calls out of its range

Still no cutting scores Still no cutting scores
Loved it tell the update it keeps crashing
Wind speed does not show on Samsung galaxy S4. ....
Lousy Does not accept the address properly. Meru needs to get the act straight on this app.
DID NOT LOAD I wanted to play it it looked really fun But it needs to load first in order to play Plz fix and I'll give 5 stars thank u  
bad, has no text after opening the app i saw that there was no text so i could not understand how to play  please improve would have given it zero stars
Sucks . useless app Sucks .useless app False advertsing on how great this app is...one can only check certain channels approximately  10 or so and cannot pick anything else. Easier to use the banner system on the decoder itself.
Disconnects all the time I have only had it for a month and it keeps disconnecting.... my WiFi is not slow and the device keeps losing Signal from my phone even with all the bars
Still want a refund You said you fixed it but it's still far to slow could I please just get my refund as I'm not using it and I've re downloaded football manager 2014 as I think it's much better
It keeps going up to level 8 I beat the game but it keeps flashing. Fix and then I will give more stars
Wrong items Constantly linking to def wrong items...scan babywipesfood thermometer. Scan fruit squash drinkgold bead sandals to name two of many examples UNINSTALLING
Update Sucks Good board game. Graphics are really bad. Paying for HD is stupid. No multiplayer. Expensive inapp purchases.
Very booooring hated it.. It's rather irritating than funny.games should be Timepass..not like this. Please do not install
Nonsense game No features...

Its just ok It needs to be able to get instructions how to use the bonus points like what is 05  And Earn hints that's a joke and then all the ads, I'm just going to delete this app
I would like a refund, please. My daughter bought this game without my consent, so if you would be so kind as to refund me the money, that would be fantastic.
Fun but glitchy Got thru several levels, then the game froze, wouldn't let me move on. Tried skipping it even though I answered correctly but it kept bringing me back to the same question  it cost me the coins. Can't play anymore since it's froze.
What's the problem Not being able to download the additional data. Obb plz help
Won't let me register It says it can't load and to try again later.

Boring
Too Much Ads Is this a game or ad show 
Fix It Never had I used an useless app like this before. It has the most bugs I have ever seen This is a poor app...

Cool but till recent update... Now whenever i try to get into angel upgrade the game crashes... It keeps on crashing while playing too... Dev team correct this issue... I wud def give a 5 star.... I am using xperia z2
No It might have been fun 4 years ago, but it runs slowly, everything lags, it's all one big blob of content and it's one of the few times where I say Clash of Clans is better.
Nexus 4 Same error as the others.... Error Marmalade V6.0.6 323198 please fix it asap thanks
Unfair business practices I paid for all of the levels in this game and I had to Uninstall and reinstall the game, and now you want me to pay for the levels again You either give me the levels I paid for or I will complain to the BBB
       ,   ,   
So much for access Downloaded but can't access. What's the point of Vitality Drive if I can't pair with your device Hopefully some consumers are seeing these reviews before signing up.
Tooooo faaaast....i used to love this game i only finished the 7 first stages
It was fun while it lasted, but half the time it gets stuck loading, and now it doesn't run at all...
Won't work Entered information, screen is blank. Want it to work. Can't even get the stars right. Would give it a 1.
Misleading Says you supposed to buy but no pay option
Not free false advertising
Does NOT work under childrestricted user account On my Nexus 7, I have a restricted account for my kids. Toca Builder says it can't validate with server and just dies under the child account but works under the main account.  This is a problem.
Worst Game Ever I know you have to pay to get everything but it would not even let you paint you nails on one whole hand
Won't install. Won't download.
Christmas is gone  worst update ever After the update it crashes...anytime, any place, during races, during scrolling on the maps.  Also wasting gems because scrolling is not smooth and accidentally places items.  Frustrating
Worst, it doesn't even open
New Update doesn't work on Droid Turbo Old version of this App was awesome, my favorite game. Just updated and now it crashes almost immediately.
Mando SNS Sucks I hate mandatory participation in social networking. I feel leveraged by the neccessities of convienence Sell yourself out to the almighty internet power of google. How did I ever survive without you
Ads For a children's educational app i am disgusted that there are ads for hot sexy videos Rather than pay to have them removed we are uninstalling. Thankfully it is an app we use together and my child didn't click on it. Shameful.
Absulutley Hate It Whenever I try to jump it wont let me and I couldent go any other way. I hate this game and I do not recomand iit
Very good game but only a few free levels I lovee this game but theres only about 67 challenges available. Wish they would have more free levels.
Jaipur ka to h hi nhi
Slow game play but good when you get into it 
BS You should fix this game. I play people with a way higher level and even when they miss they're still getting points. This is stupid Why is their no female characters
Stops working constantly Useless app. Doesn't work. Stops working every single time I use it.
Beware Scam Low rating because they try to scam you. The icon to buy coins sometimes has a banner that says sale. When you click it there is an option to get 4000 coins 100 free, then it tries to charge you 20.
Nothing This  is nothing close to what they have online. all you can do is color. if you're going to have an app you need to have the same stuff you have on your web page. That the kids fall in love with.
Too many pop ups and ads Game is ok...but after Every game pop ups pimping their other games...very annoying...deleted
Doesn't work I just installed this app, but have been unable to make it function as it does on my iPhone. Very disappointed.
I want my many to back
Sorry slightly annoyed will not even open says error marmlade or something like that pleaseeee fix 
What is this OK first of all on my phone all it shows is a black screen when I want to play it then I want to get out if it and it takes time to go back to my home screen so if I were you DO NOT DOWNLOAD
Tight slots and minimum bets are too high you only get a few spins from the first two games because you never have enough coins to take even one spin of other games. ..don't waste your time.
Stupid game Just by looking screenshots it's a nice one but it's a too boring
Jackpot  party I'm unstalling the game Reason  being  is because  it takes  to long to load, also i hit the big win. But the freezes
Danny and kai Do Hhjhjgggh
Why oh why Why didn't u add rainbow dashs tail and mane pls add it and I'll give u give stars
Useless, why change a gud app to useless 1
Crashes on start up Note 4 user here. The app crashes on start up and I am unable to use it. I sent a report today when I first experienced the issue. Please reply
Okay if it was free This game is not worth your money. It's boring and I quit after 15 minutes of playing. Can i have my money back please
What Indie music I had the volume all the way up and still could not hear anything. The game worked. But no sound. Sorry but I uninstalled.
Hard to use Uses my phones internal camera so I have to turn the phone around to scan stuff blind and there is no settings to change this
Lost all my photos for the 2nd time Again ....  locked my photos with this app and after few days I opened the app to see them but I didn't find any thing....this is shit I can't find my photos. And I'm wating from you developers to answer me.
Tighter than any casino I have ever played at .   And I have spent money just to watch it disappear  each time good god maybe you should  not be so tight Bad
Suckes bull DONT DOWNLOAD IF YOU DUDES DO YOU WILL HAVE BAD LUCK AND HAVE A FEAR AND YOUR MOM WILL KILL U GUYS GOOD LUCK AND WONT HAVE A GIRLFREIND
Really. On the pics it shows an actual laser light. But in reality its just blinking lights
Not working Would rate more stars seeing as i have quite a few of the bradford learning games for 4 of my children, this is the only one that after purchasing says it cannot load on this tablet... If this is fixable will give higher rating
Dumb App I keep loseing
It does not work This app is useless
Waste of my time After loosing my progress for the 4th time because it cant connect to the server always right after my first match i uninstalled it right away. Life is too short.
IT DOESNT WORK YOU HAVE TO BE LOGGED IN
The online mode cost me 20k Why my opponent get more shots than I do  I got 1 shot , he got like 3 shots ahead of me , and I shoot fast ..Suddenly , He got over 300 and I got 100 and less shots.And when shot , it sometimes goes wrong.
Stupid Worthless
Game is fake
 
Sucks This game sucks, it crashes everytime i touch the string. Fuck off tiny spider
Not very cool in my book This app sucks I purchased it from my iPad and it installed on a device  I don't even own anymore . Now I'm out my money and an app I paid for.
Requires Access to Messages I don't understand if this app is real, why must it access my messages This may be one of many ways it trys to convince you there are real ghosts nearby.
S4 LTEA Not suitable for big screen user, because some function is on top of screen, after zoom in can't move around in photo, slow process. Hope can improve
No way to use on social media I got this because none of the smilies in my phone reflect my faith.  But these can't be pulled up when posting on social media galaxy s5 user and also, they're way too large and goofy looking.  Disappointed. 
Not for me Thanks
It Say or Sad up up sh I starts off liR pict of me th orTha utu g Review un Ga this allr a litt but s to slow when a city  injwr liL
Everything is over priced I like the concept and the game play is good but...the adds are bad and to compete at any level you have to spend lots of real money. My advice spent the money on a real set and go play.
Great game but online needs changing Online game is riddled with problems
New update doesn't work
369 super way Leno I've bought more then one of ur games my bad None of them will open n no one will refund me
Load of crap Bad controls bad graphics ads that interrupt  the basic game play.
Crashes or invalid license Bought on sale a while back and still feel cheated.  Will not run on my KitKat tablet.  Runs on Fire TV but can't control it without a Moga controller.  Typical Gameloft.
Real shame Great game idea its shameless that it doesn't work anymore Long waits to load, constantly kicking players out and hanging... Don't waist your time Useless support Real developers should make other game of the type, this one is over
Worst Game Its the worst game evermorphed pictures and no challenge is d only reason DAT its a worst gameBut the game has amazing graphics,but no proper opponentsTime waste
App won't open on Android device A bit disappointed, and i say a bit, only cuz i make it a point never to rely on free apps any more.  My daughter colored in 5 pictures of her new book and got all excited, only to be let down by the app.
Won't start at all Crashes when starting first level, tried reinstalling a few times and clearing cache etc but it just crashes as soon as the first cut scene begins every time Nexus 6 running 5.1.
It won't work. I've tried clicking, dragging, and tilting and I t still won't work. The farthest I can get is to the ice pack part. Uninstalling.
Crazy dentist Thank you Bryan montano and Loretta love that is true why does it only go to 8 levels the person that made this game needs to fix it if you do I will put more stars
Possible spyware A flashlight app this large Looks very suspicious to me. I uninstalled this immediately. Too much malware around here.
Nice game. Run smooth but need some solid graphic support as sometimes mountains got vanished only runway remains in view in result plane crashes in  mountains.
Crashes I can barely use this app all it does is crash yet it works fine for my brother on his galaxy s4 please fix compatibility for my phone thank you
I hate this game so much I hate it because there is only one room unlocked.
Poor This app is very bad. Despite the control's allowing you to block the droid from been able to use rare and vulgar word's the droid still manages to play them Be careful if you allow children to play this game, they can use and learn swear word's
It's 1 hrs still SMS ot reached I thought service would have been improved but its same what was 1 year back so again removing the app
Game stopped loading Never had a problem with this game, but today the game will not load Had in app purchases and now the game won't work
Use Home widget, freezes phone Nice app, great looking widget, using Nexus 6 and it freezes the home screen for 5 seconds. No swipe, no tap, then phone comes to life. I will give it a few days but its annoying. Not happy
Removed ads return Paid to have ads removed but after reinstall ads are back. No response from developer, email or otherwise. Flagged, if you have same problem I suggest flagging as well.
Cannot run I paid for install.but cannot run one time.i use samsung galxy s6 edge 32g.
What's happening Box w message says be back on line in 2 hours. I seen this the first time at 730pm est. It is now 945pm est. Will I be able to play your game today
Doesn't work with Android 5 Keeps saying it needs an internet connection. Needs fixed
Hate hate hate Every time you don't reach your goal it takes you back to the begining and it gets borging after a while
Not working 65 Stops updating for a couple days occasionally in the last few months. Reinstalling doesn't help.
       
I aint able to check anything beyond the topics... Even after selecting ALL the topics it is taking me back to the topics page.. again n again... Can u pls check this
App crashed App used for a game and didn't start anymore due to error requiring downloads. I want a refund
Boring and glitchy Got three errors in one minute. Very limited game. Uninstalling
Deinstalls itself Same as in Mintho's case the Pro version deinstalls itself on my Galaxy S5 with Gear smartwatch. It is a long lasting problem reported many times before and preventing me from using the app.
Game freezes a lot. Please fix it. Also Pippi's voice is too British
They lied They said hints were free
bakwas fzool .folish .time waste .its only i p l .
Freezing It keeps freezing on register and login page and it can't find login info for me or my wife. WTH r u people doing Sitting down and making money for nothing
Updated and still doesn't work for galaxy tab S Fix the constant crashing on tab S and I will rerate
A good game overall Reduced to 1 star because after the last update the game uninstalled hinself losing my entire progress and all my purchases.
Fazool
Please fix the repinning notification and I'll return it to 5 stars. I have been barely using the app since this error occured.
Garbage
No more bonus points So ready to delete  don't get to play much.  Would rather go to a real casino before purchase points for this.
Don't download games
Wtf. All my maps are gone..... i bought like 6 maps awhile ago, tried to restore my purchases nothing worked. I would like to get a refund or my maps back.
Really Do an update that kicks everyone out Ya this game was great until your update just kicked everyone out. Do you want people to not play your game anymore The update did the opposite of what you wanted...
New adware is a loser This app went from great to poor after adding an annoying  trending apps near you floating button that is always in your face.  Time to look for a better alternative.
Love it
Sucks If you make a first down and get tackeled its not a first down. The worst yards. Who cqme up with 1st and 50 It just sucks
Horrid It was awful. Absolutely rubbish and the other side of the most of your choice of the sun is out of stock and will not be published in for 8th 8 I can do to make it. I love o
Cartoon network is better than this...
It's not work
  .
way toooo easy. absolutely no challenge.
Don't update Don't update the game because you will not be able to play the game. Can't login.  Booooooooooo negative 10 stars. And i just had bought the vip ticket.  Booooooo
Its a blank space i dont know how to put an story
This app has offers for free chips but the offers seldom ever pay the player. Then when you write for help they say it's a third party problem and they can't help.
I thought this would be pretty cool I standed corrected you can't do anything unless u buy the full app which costs money u can only do  3 nails this is a complete rip out
A simple cyclic would be better Need better control of the cyclic. The touch pad doesn't respond sometimes.
Locks up phone to get out of app. Uninstalled
Weird people on chat Didn't bother trying to play as world chat was in the middle of men hitting on a supposedly 11 year old girl.... Wtf great gaming standards you guys have there uninstalled immediately.
It will not download at all. Refund by chance My son was very excited for it and it wont work.
Questionable permissions Why does this app need the following permissions 1. Access to my photosmediafilesexternal storage  2. Access to my camera 3. FULL Access to my network, including to view all my WiFi and network connections 4. Run at startup
Why offer it in Canada if it's not going to work This app is why people switch to uber. Don't give me my address and tell me where I am unless you can actually request a taxi. Terrible and misleading business model
Basics doesn't even work Cannot log in, PLEASE FIX
Good Needs some material design and still no nfc balance check and no way to disable push notifications
No way Doesn't even play back the voice at the end let alone save it. Stupid app don't get it
Once quick and fun I liked it once. Now overloaded with bloat and ads. They successfully squeezed out every bit of fun.  Amazing what greed does to gaming companies.
I don't  know . . Needs more people  RIGHT IF AGREED
Ridiculous even for kids Don't waste your time.
No audio I made calls for 2 days just fine now I make a call and can't hear anything. I uninstalled it and reinstalled it and still not working I'm done with it. It don't work anyway
Very disappointed Will no longer install on my phone since I upgraded to Kit Kat please fix this since I have purchased the app and it is one of my favorite apps.
Glitch Get to level 6 in first challenge and theres no other cars around while racing but saying I'm coming 4th can't continue on with game. Please help.

Fix it I want to play this app when i opened the game i picked up mr cuddles with dog flash cuddles fly and then it message  unfortunately jetpack joyride has stopped please fix it i not want to broke my tablet

KEEPS CLOSING KEEPS CLOSING ON ASUS TF300T JELLY BEAN DON'T BUY AS IT WILL TAKE LONGER TO DOWNLOAD THAN YOU CAN GET A REFUND AS YOU HAVE TO DOWNLOAD ADDITIONAL  CONTENT BEFORE YOU CAN PLAY, VERY POORLY DEVELOPED GAME
Xperia ion hspa Waste on my money..just can open the intro video and crash after it and make my phone restart.secondly try it same.need to resolve this and feedback ASAP
Repair karalo
Won't load Every time I try to play this, it starts to load but only goes up to 8. Then after a couple minutes, it says its not responding. Please fix
It wouldn't play videos I clicked the videos and it kept saying no connection if fixed I would defo rate five
So Many ads Ads are everywhere, no readability. Not good at all, you guys can do far better than this.
Y'all are gonna have a baby someday and it will have a private part when your baby comes out are u gonna be like ewww it has a private part And I agree with dollface beauty
Won't let me register Kinda dumb if you can't register
Zoom problem I normally love this app but lately when reading some mangas automatically zoom out so far that they appear as tiny black dots  and they stay that way in later episodes please fix so i can keep reading happily and give 5 stars
US propaganda Ok but still US propaganda. Free comics and kids stuff from political issues and hatred. It is a place to help take our minds off the reality and all those US wars.
Dani Rubbish don't work
Needs an update. Strike out way too often. The pitchers stamina makes no sense and too many foul balls. Batting should be more based off of the stats I am doing a season and my best hitters are doing the worst
Selection tool does not work after last upgrade.
Runs a little slow Tons of memory on my phone, nothing else lags but this game still runs slow.  In a game that requires timing that's a killer.
DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE So I just played it like yesterday and now when I launch it . It says  Application not authorized for use on your android device  What the heckk
Worst.
Won't connect to heart rate monitor HRM was the only reason I paid for the pro version. Plenty of other apps will connect with my HRM just fine, but this one won't.
Nao tem funao de lock screen Deveria ter uma funcao para desabilitar o toque da tela. Assim a criana nao aperta o home ou cancel sem querer enquanto segura o aparelho. A versao para o iPhone tem.
WTF Ain't downloading.
Lagging and doesn't refresh automatically Was Good , this update ruin the app completely. It is horrible and questions won't refresh on opening the app. Every time I open the app I see previous questions.
IT SUCKS IT DOSENT HAVE FAIRY TAIL
Nice
Why cant you do castling Castling is one of my favorite moves in the game, and to not see it in this game really disappoints me, would love to give a higher rating, but it wasn't included.
It is very boring
My phone couldnt even open the app HTC One M9. It froze on the loading screen
CRAP It won't even log in,  it keeps saying my right password is wrong.
Funny game I love that game because I play it sooo muchhhhhh
Am I the sucker Seriously.. I don't get enough coins witch upsets me n its kinda boring 4 meso I jus play other games
Fix it I enjoyed playing this game when it was good now the servers are all messed up and its barely playable with all this lag.... and also fix lax lagoon i cant log on to my main guy... a new server already down..... 5 stars when i can get back on
Does not do what it promised I invited friend to this game, but could not receive 15k. Bad experience.
Liked
Needs work Have to tap several times to get things to work, not a lot of options, and it freezes mid into it.
Bakwas game hate it
Porcaria Reinicia sozinho toda hora. No d para usar. Quando conecta via Bluetooth no carro fica informando que a licena expirou.
Won't connect Over a month later and it's still not working...... Keeps telling me that I need Internet access when I know I do. It's been doing this for weeks.
Won't let me go into the game Every time I try and open the app it restarts. And when its finally letting me play, it says Sorry No WiFi Connection. I have WiFi, but why won't it let me play
Getting annoying to play The number of pop up ads is totally ridiculous if I could take back one star I would and I would only give it 3 stars.........NOW DOWN TO 2 STARS
new stars Great. Nice work, But we still need group chat, Hmm 'nd I'll rate you 5star
I used to play this game all the time before I updated the game but now I hate it cuz before the update I was very good at this game so I hope they change it back hopefully soon so I can get back into drifting
Rip off My daughter desperately wanted to see her own coloring come to life. However this app does absolutely nothing I hold my phone over the page for upwards of a minute and nothing,nada,zip,zero. Way to crush a kids smile Disney.
Never works properly For a modern everyday user based company this is unacceptable
I cant even get in.
Every time I try to open it, it shows the opening credits and then just exits automatically
Unhappy The app doesn't work. It freezes when I view trips or when I want to make some edits on my trips when I'm not the driver. It says I'm speeding when I am within the speed limit...no ways. It needs some serious work.
Game is broken When I beat my high score I cannot continue playing..... Please fix this
Needs more..... I am on level 51, my sticker book is full, I didn't get a reward for doing so except for the diamonds for completing each page, now there's nothing to look forward to. Please update soon or will be forced to uninstall.........
Does not load Never loads
Crushed Every time i open the app... it stopped and shut down. The last update is seriously rubbish. Fix it.. i will give 5 stars
 It's a boring game.......
Advanced protection is not working.. Hey I hide the app by the advanced protection option  But i can't get back it in to my home menu. The ways to open the hidden appslock application are not working  Wat a dam is this..
Bad one Very irritating app..... poor picture.... loud music...... my son dont like it
Game reset itself lost everything Bought the game... still had in app purchases... anyways bought 2 guns extra spent another 10.. ok cool... playing for almost 2 weeks today everything is reset Lost my purchases and progress wtf Nice scam thx
Too many glitches. I used to love it but now the balls fly all over in the wrong direction
NEED A REFUND OR FIX IT. IT KEEPS SAYING UNLICENSE VERSION OF WEdDING DASH DELUX PLEASE FIX OR GIVE ME A REFUND
Buggy Doesnt recalculate direction. As others have said it says W when pointing N, S or E. Even when gps is toggled off then back on. Disappointing on the Note 3.
Can't download and can't refund, hate it.
It's not free.
Freezes up on my Xperia z1 Seems to work fine at times but now it just freezes up the moment I click battle. Used to freeze up on random screens warranting a restart. Now even a restart is not helpful. I'm not having so much fun anymore. Unhappy.
Good app but... You expect if you pay for it that removes the adverts. Sadly this is not the case. Terrible money grabbing.
Monopoly bingo Haven't played in 6 days due to connection issues...keeps telling me no internet access.  None of my other games are having problems...has to be this games glitch somewhere.   Needs to be fixed
2 things i dont like about this game This game takes up alot of space and yet only ONE recipe is unlocked This game don't deserve 5 stars at all
I  LOVE  THE   GAME   VERY  MUCH Jerusha
Never works It doesn't update location even after several hours. This is no good when I want to check my daughter is still where she says she is.
Glitch that kills me. After Checkpoint 1 when nothing is ahead of me, my character dies. If you fix the glitch i will rate 5 stars
Since the last update I am unable to get in...just says retrieving data..please fix this and I will give more stars...
Free letters gone I have no idea what happened but now every letter I get I have to pay 10 credits for. I can't afford to buy credits just to read even the first letter which use to be free
Free Until my daughter starts playing it and it says we have to buy the full version what a rip off Delete this app
The lip sync The lip sync is always off. please fix it especially when you pay for an app. Other than that it's really fun my children
Capt.Christian I couldn't login with my existing account let me know when you fix this I eventually did manage to log on but it doesn't display any vessels and yes I'm connected the older version displays vessels so my rating remains the same
Don't work I went on it and it won't load the songs. Fix it I thought I was going to like the fame but it doesn't work
Only hind is there
Problem The screen goes black whenever i start  to play it
I have wasted my money. I cannot cast properly. The casting seems to work in the reverse.when reeling and tilting back lowers the rod tip Am so disapointed
It doesnt gets open This game doesnt start at all
No money Do and I say do not buy anything you can't get your money back
Broken on Note 4 The app seems to think my phone has a menu button, which it does not. I am unable to get to any menu functions to save or export cartoons. Used to love this on Note 2, now it's unusable.
Zaib If you play every stage with full stars then you will have not enough credit to purchase the required cars for races. But you can only purchase them by real money which is too expensive. So Not Good Game at all. Waste of time
I hate this game I don't want to give it 5 stars.When I want to put the music off it puts the sound of the car. Do not download this game.  It's really boring.
Worst game.. I have purchased this game and I'm shocked that it won't open and force close.  This is after sending maeby crash reports and the developer hasn't responded.. Give my money  back as you guys won't rectify the problem. 
Annoying when opening I would love to see the ability to turn off the location tracker. Open it and click on my favourite only to have the location tracker move everything.  A real pain.

Visibility I should be able to control regarding who knows i am on whatsapp. Its not necessary i want everybody having my number to know i am using whatsapp. It should ask 2 options visibility to all or selected contacts

Hate it It comes on the screen then goes off .Don't play it
Great idea, needs better execution The app is appallingly bad. The idea is great but it needs to be designed and developed better. Do a major update, probably a version 2.0, and it can be a very fun game
Do not download Tried deleting 6 times, now I have to update in my attempt to delete for the 7th time. Do not download, the game is alright but it really is just a virus.

Most irritating app in the world due to ads Non sense app. Not just so many full page ads which will occupy your whole screen, but also in bw it will start some 30 sec video. And most imp it will open some bad reputation web sites for ads. Non sense
Horrendous DO NOT BUY Having played and loved the Freeplay app,  I purchased this.  Biggest mistake EVER  Graphics and game play,  awful.  Cant even get a refund as just missed the 15 minute deadline.  AVOID

Poor Tapatalk is a much more reliable and versatile forum plugin. Forum Runner crashes regularly, has image cache problems and hangs. Unfortunately there are few vialable alternatives.
HATE IT This game is no fun don't download it please warning do not download this game it takes out the fun of everything
Downloaded the game but it keeps going back to home page. I can't even try to play it. Sucks
Good app
Not happy I used to have this on my iPhone  first thing I noticed was the music changed.loved the old music but most importantly, it took 102 spins before I got free spins 20  out of that I got measly 3500 and I am playing the dream setting
Don't download Paid for and downloaded, it doesn't get past the loading page and comes up with an error but won't even give the option to refund
The issue was the music It wouldn't go away after closing the app or my phone it was weird it just kept playing...
Please fix it. No longer working The app loads and  the place where you can choose Pepa or George  to paint with now only shows a settings button  in the corner on a white screen. There is no place to report the bugs
Kept freezing Kept freezing every time I tried to use the apps I set to a certain orientation
Not happy Just won battle 11 and it went to home screen when the battle was over and say i didnt win it and my dinosaurs i used in resting stage and not happy at all the only reason i keep this is because of my nephew

Crashes on ooening Won't open on my HTC one m8, the data Downloads to 100 then it immediately closes, very disappointing, waste of money
Um Few free games and they are NOT educational.  3 bucks to unlock the rest.  I'm not even sure if they are better than the free ones.  Maybe I'm just pampered from having ABC mouse on my tablet for my 2.5 year old.
Still Still not letting me get back onto my old account. I prefer the old Twitter that allows you to get on without extra information.
OMG I hate it that every company now wants money for everything like more then half of the stalks cost 1 dollar wow
Don't Download.. It poses old questions after updates no new addition in questions.Dont waste your time.
Paid app is providing spam messages about German television programme. No, thanks.

It is a nice looking app but it's moon VOC timing is wrong and it does not show the start and end VOC times. As these are important to my use, I am rather disappointed. Please fix this. I have Pro version.
Google Plus photo issue I am able to see my picture but noone else can, I log in through google Plus, is there any way to fix this, also why can't you link google plus and facebook accounts for friends. Please fix
Would not load on Samsung tablet. This sucks
Pieces r too small n thy r not visible. Boring jst wasted my datab
Nothing like other Sims games This game is nothing like the other Sims games. The town map is very limited, and your Sims cannot have a family. The only advantage of this game is that you do not need to have a WiFi connection in order to play it.
Good
Would be nice since its paid version if it could be used for messages as well as messenger. Only good for Facebook all others show links and the other party has to install it to view.
Don't buy Not worth it Very hard to play, instructions are terrible. I've spent over 5 on top of the game purchase. It doesn't save anything for you.
Won't even start. It keeps saying it stopped. Wanting a refund.
Keeps freezing Wont load and keeps freezing. How can u charge for this game. its a scam
Stopped working almost immediately after installation.
Now is the time Ok, lets be honest. The Acer Iconia One 7 has bugs. It just won't work. You really need to fix it. It was working in 0.10.5, but in 0.11.1 it won't work on the Acer Iconia One 7.
Crash fest I can do nothing without it crashing or kicking me out. Otherwise it would be a fine time waster.
Wtf Dowloaded on galaxy s5 just get a white screen. I can add a rifle but that's it just a white screen.
Game won't play Every time I try to play counting the squares on the grid it won't accept my answer.  Please fix
Its good and all needs lefty It really needs a left handed setting I like it but I hardly use it simply because there's no lefty setting . Very unfair
Frustrating lack of control Was going OK but now have reached a stage where all controls vanish so can't make any more progress.
Bike Bikeisbest
Won't launch after the 5.1.1 update. This is the third time I had to change my review. You guys need to buck up.
Cant make bookings In late 2014 the app simply wouldnt load seating and would just hang. Happened on my S3 and same happened when I changed to a Note 4. Whats the point of a ticket booking app if you cant book tickets
It is not that bad The game is somehow.  Why can't we skip the one we don't know. Who so ever created this game should really work on it batter. I wish I never downloaded it. Meanwhile it still helps me with other logo games.
Atrocious app to go with a bad game Loads of lag make the microphones terrible in use. The actual singstar game is disappointing, not playing as well as lips and a poor music catalogue.  Singstar for ps3 looks like it has a far bigger selection.
Too many ads You can't actually play the game because of pop up ads. The developer of this should be ashamed
Used to enjoy this I really dont knkw what happened to the game..i purchased this way back last 2013 and i tried to install it to my new phone now and it does not open.. I hope you could help me out here..
Bluetooth Forces bluetooth on and stays on. Consumes battery life. This app suck

This doesn't work I have an awful virus on my phone and I've done a lot to try and get rid of it I did research and everything and I downloaded this thinking it would help but all it is, is a show
Annoying popups  Video Ads What once was a great game is now crippled by intrusive ads, sometimes popping up  right in the middle of a shot
Annoing Every time i try to press a button it dosnt work and crashes and it realy gets on my nerves so whoever hates this and finds it annoing like i think it is i totaly agree on you
This games sucks I tapped things and it wouldnt pick it up there are no good directions in the game like other games like this habe. This game is just crap

Awful Game Basically if you don't go first and you always go last the other players get ALL the fortune cards and ALL the properties. Where's the return option on this app...
Love Stratego Hate screen size Love the game but its almost impossible for me to setup my pieces. The tiles are way to small and makes it very frustrating when I move the wrong piece constantly. Fix that and the game will be awesome.
Jobs are all male Why is that Can't women be doctors or scientists
Crashes My son loves this app but can't play it. Please fix for a 5 star rating.
This game closes every time I open it
Refund When I first purchased this I saw a tab to refund. Since I went out it is not there. I want refund
Loved it, not after getting a new phone. Wouldn't transfer to new phone, even for the money I spent. Thanks for nothing.
Should allow to change country Should at least allow me to configure default country, as I am not in USA, website works better as it at least shows you the weather of last course searched.. App should do the same to deserve a 5 star
Rubbish  Unbelievable lag and constant adds, deleting after 5 minutes
UuGggHhhhh I've had this app for 2 weeks and IT STILL DOESN'T LOAD TO THE GAME  All me and my four year old get is a loading screen.............

The more you buy the faster you lose At first I loved this game.  I thought it was different from the rest.  Then they got too big and started to not let the ones who buy chips win.  Uninstalling this game.  Find another game to play.
Uninstall There's no way to set the difficulty. One suit is just too easy. I can win 100 of the time.
Takes way too much time to establish connection.
 It would be better if you could buy land with the coins you earn instead of with dollars seeing how you only get dollars very few and far between. And also the battles are rigged
Just boring The game was pitiful and boring.worms are more fun than this game.
Not good, not accurate, many places missing. Value 1 cent...

Please fix I like the game alot but the button that let you pick a new game, or go to the main menu, COULD YOU OF MADE IT ANY SMALLER Plus a stalemate happens after 10 moves not after 3 moves
The game is busted Totally pay to win. NO penalty for NEVER feeding your troops allows armies so large strategy and tactics mean nothing.  Only thing that matters is how much money spend buying stuff.
Kinda sucks. Terrible sounds, flat level design and a wimpy multiplayer. I kind of expected more out of this game. What a let down.
Not Good At All The Worst Racing Game...

Why would anyone pay real money to win fake money It was fun for awhile until I played the blackjack table. I have never seen in my life people stupid enough to hit on 19s and 20s. Unless it's a ploy to get me to BUY chips. What a load of pus.
Have it on dream winnings, I have to spin 50 times before I get a bonus feature. I spun 290X before I won more than 30 in a bonus round.
Don't let your kids play unsupervised. My 8 year old was able to change my Google pasword and charge over 500 in app purchases all through this app. Google wallet team did help me but, the game is set up to spend money.

Not opening Now..  WTF I like the game,  and i like it because i play this game.  Now when ever open the game The black screen appears and nothing happens next.....
so cool It's agood game to the beginers
Decent at best The fact is that it's a typical match 3 puzzle game with an interesting development interface  misrepresenting it as an adventure  or dungeon Crawler  is forgivable,  but charging 3 bucks years after release is crappy

Its OK but No Nvidia Shield means I can't play it on the device it would be best on. Total fail. Some devs amaze me at how little they want their audience to be.
Receive notification every 5 minutes although it is set to refresh every hour. Become very irritating.

 D

Shame Really beautiful fun  interesting game but it KEEPS CRASHING After every mission or 2 it crashes. I could be in the middle of a misson and it would crash. This makes me not want to have this game at all. Its a shame.
Great tool but with a catch Was using it on the free verion, everything was ok and fine. Since last update some root features became accessible only with the pro version, that is unnecessary expensive.
Please listen to us We dont wat t wait 3 hours jus for 2 hours passes listen to us or we will tell other kids or teens or whatever that they shouldn't get this game cuase it will suck so fix it now
It won't stay up the moment I start drawing it crashes or closes itself its really fun and I would like to have it but won't keep it unless its fixed
Boring Can't do anything without machetes and you rarely get them.  I currently have 6 tasks  5 require 1 machetes and the other is beyond my level.  Gave this game 2 weeks but it is still boring.  
Dumb All you do is missions for nothing but the computer one seems good but the this game is to get money for computer version
WORST GAME EVER I thought it would be a great game but this was the worst game I ever played. Only if you could've kept it as u will touch the screen and the bots will hit then it would've been a great game. So please make the changes
Level 57 very difficult to play, please update the game so as to be able to get to the next level, adding a ball of the same color but it still go further.

Was a Nice app Doesn't work anymore it won't even load the location map just gives error message
No Facebook login... Means this app is currently useless to me unless there is another way of linking to my account on the desktop site
Overrides screen pinning Pressing the back button closes the app, so as soon as baby mashes his hands in that area, the pinned app closes and the device goes to lock screen.
Horrible The app never plays the music that you choose and when it does play something it just keeps playing and you have no access to the app it goes into a loop where whenever you open it out instantly exit the app
Not working App says update to ver 1.06 I'm on 1.07

Could be a good game but there's never enough resources to actually play for a while you have to wait for machetes you have to wait for money or you have to purchase it with real  money I think I'll stick with Sims FreePlay
Too easy Good game but it's way too easy. I get a fish on every 10 seconds. There's no challenge. I've gotten bored with it quickly
Average Bloody hell the only focus of the maker is on advertisement really fed up with these advertisement
Terrible app Terrible app, search function doesn't work, gives you about 20 games in each category to browse through, want you to pay for games that others have made, really all around poorly designed and not at all worth the money they want for it.
ADD MORE STUFF First it was funny now it's blahh u need new people and other stuff
Don't open Would love a refund.
Letters not avaliable I paid money for this Why is my keyboard on the game all the sudden blocking out 90 of the letters I need to use How am I supposed to play this game I want my money back immediately.
This game is awful I almost deleted this before I even opened it but I decided to give it a chance
Not well done It just kept on loading and I didn't  get a chance to play the game
Too Fast Mark Crilley goes too fast and he should do it slowly so young drawers like I can keep up.
There is no web page with which to enter data This app had so much promise, but data entry via a smartphone alone is not the way to go
Shutting down Paid for this app and it keeps force closing on me....   common guys fix it...  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL ITS FIXED OTHERWISE YOUR JUST WASTING YOUR MONEY   If this issue ever gets fixed I will change my negative feedback
Not good for those who cannot see well
Michael fix your app I paid for this app but it does not do what it is built for. My cpu goes up to 1.7 and i have max 1.2 ghz. Thus it does not control my cpu at all.. i have a rooted galaxy s4 unlocked bootloader. If you fix this then 5 stars
Would be nice if it worked Tried to get it to work. But, no luck.

Rdio player is LAME Reducing to 2 stars since there are no lock  screen controls if you have notifications set to Hide Sensitive Content in Lollipop.  Amazon Music and Rocket Player handle this fine. LOLLIPOP IS NOT NEW ANYMORE.
I can't play When I go to a game mode it stops plz fix it
Can only play against one other computer player, other wise the ai will always sacrifice one by only attack you. Plus, the sign in feature won' t let you just say no.
Dear Game Makers Have Purchased the game but its not getting installed in my phone. Kindly advise. Am a POP fan. Like to play it.  Thanks in advsance.
Can't even download Wtf I can't even download this game to play it.
Bugs and crashes The new layout is horrible. Everything used to be so simple. It is unintuitive, and it has way more bugs and crashes than before
This game is not running in my micromax a110 Android mobile. This game is not runningopening in my micromax A110 Android mobile
Crashes App no longer works in latest update. Constantly crashes.  Even when it's not running it will pop up and say it has stopped working.
Um yea It works, just not in my messages. Only on social media sites. Kinda disappointing.
OK but I do like the models, but Coach's Eye is a better app.
Keeps turning off in the middle of playing... Which results in crying toddler After paying 7 I am an unhappy mommy
Worse mb of my life I hate it the graphics is horrible Stupid
App won't even open Force closes as soon as I try to launch it
Great App When I initially downloaded the game it worked perfectly. But I've gotten to a certain point an now the game doesn't want to start up, it'll immediately shut down. Having trouble downloading it to my new device same model though
App closes without GPS This is the biggest, most stupid waste of power the developer could've put in. Pull the speed data off the OBD connection. Save the battery power, AND save me the waste of time enabling gps when my phone's GPS is dead.
Crying Son I downloaded this for my son who was super excited, and this game doesn't even get passed the user selection screen.  You've basically ruined our evening here.
Issues So, the king can't move at it's please How's that And after 2 times playing this game stopped when the rate message pops up. Then i couldn't resume the game again.  Plus using almost 90 Mb of ram Really No thanks.
Brb game I hate this it doesn't let me do somthing
No cloud saves While I did enjoy the game, not having some kind of cloud savebackup just ruins it when you move devices, get a new device, have to wipe a device...
Buggy It shows single tick for the Message I sent to my contacts . But they don't receive my messages ... irritating ... wifi3g
It keeps saying my device is either rooted or illegal when I try to play this game. Why's it doing that Fix it please.
Can't load Can't load . pls fix it
VERY NO FUN... Very dissapointed Can't Open it 
Note edge Crashing, not loading articles. When it does bother to load an article, won't let you scroll. Terrible. Need to update your update.
Will not work Force closes when opened saying forever lost 3 has stopped working LG G4. As  most others have stated, I've purchased the previous 2 in the trilogy and loved them. Will give good rating when fixed.
can't cover a nil A partner shouldn't bleed out a suit on a nil bid when the niller has shown a void suit
Acorns I enjoy the game but it is way to hard to get acorns. It's very annoying. Either make stuff cost less acorns or make it easier to get an abundance of them. The game has become worse since the update. Still having issues with the acorns.
I like the tournaments, just can't win very big.
Its nt working
 it changed .... I used to like it but it only seems to get worse. the calls aren't the best quality but I still think its a really good app to have and I'll probably never delete it
Poor customer service Sent 3 emails regarding an issue and no response back. Actually love the game but what the hell do I gotta do to a reply back
Dragging and throwing of dices are not working Couldn't drag the board to left or right when I wanted to go to my property to build houses. Can't do flick the dices as well. Using Sony Z2.
Why I have been charged twice, please refund my money back,  it takes to download too much time,I hate it
Cute but.... Why should you need to pay to do all the games
Keeps disconnecting even though my internet is fibre optic always disappoints
Most stupid app ever...wish i cud give it 0 stars
This... App bilkul bekar hai. Sound quality ekdum bakwaas hai..
Was excellent in the beginning Whenever i play youtube vids it plays correctly but when i turn my tab or cell off then mayb a few mins later cut it back on it closes all the vids i had in the queue and i have to start all over again
The only good part about it is that it makes some kind of sound. It is unresponsive and a utter waste of time.
Ploggingsproblem Klarer ikj logge p Premiumversjonen.. Sender heller ikke passord til epost.
Used to be great Bought this on my s3 mini. Now i have a galaxy s5 and can't play it with no menu buttons on new lollipop OS 
NOT REALLY FULL VERSION What full version still makes you buy the levels. Ridiculous
Still glitches. Tired of uninstalling installing every 5th game. Every. Time. Not. Kidding.
Row issues Can't place towers on bottom row which makes setting up a meaningful maze to stop the enemy impossible and basically makes the game impossible to beat. Used to be a great game when that worked but now is unplayable basically.
Pop ups an ads in game even after buying it. Disgusting.
Fun game annoying ads Watch videos to triple score or I just finished drawing after paying for this app and an ad came up for some game. Why did I pay to remove ads when they're still on here That's shady.

Horrible Update I just performed an update and I'm sorry that I did. I've been using Speedtest for almost 4 years and the latest update is choked full of ads. Uninstalling right now. I'll check back in a few months to see if common sense prevails.
I would rate it 5 stars but you can't see anything
Hmm Late sound delivery and also i cant press more than two notes and the sound doesn't match either.
Please I need to save the things I have created but when I going to leave the game it restarted over again. I'll give 5 stars. And the full version of the exploration lite I need to buy it. Do something to it. Please.
I am puzzled Why , do the settings in your app not function like the first day downloaded Fix it please , because it has potential to be a 5. With NO Support
This t.v show has just ended after 15 years, how many questions would that be  Ive had this App a week and already repeating questions, waste of money
Not Responding. Constantly crashes straight after being launched, I  don't even get the chance to choose between 'Challenge' or 'Practice' most of the time.
Glitchy Fun tests but toward the end terrible glitches make competition impossible
Crashes Only just installed, good game however after every 2 races the screen goes black and nothing happens. Almost as if an advert is suppose to load but never does. Uninstalled, will try again in a month or so.
Not working on android wear Since the last update is not working in android wear in my Moto 360. It was by far my favorite app for the watch, with the lyrics and everything. Very disappointed.
Real Bass It's a little slow in response and its only for right handed players. The sounds are a little too synth sounding for me.
Letter school Everything is upside down
Poor service Always saying route not supported. Uninstalling. Its as bad as the train service. What a joke All routes are giving problems..
Worst game This is the most worst game

Bakwaas hai
so annoying that one of the prize bonuses isn't the ability to drop new coins more quickly. this bonus is available on this developers' other dozer games, why not this one
Quora, I mean why Not even able to login with my fb account as well as there is no intent direction to a new activity on clicking forgot password.  Advice  either improve it or just shut it off.
What Happened After the update, everything got deleted. I have no true credits, it deleted all the tricks I've ever done  and it also erased every gap I've done. Fix this and then I'll give three stars.
POINTLESS The only reason I'm giving one star is simply to say WORST APP EVER
What's the problem .. I could not use the aps...
No fun. Gameplay moves like a snail. Levels are poorly designed. Not worth the 99 cents I wasted on this game. Deleted because it is taking up space on my device.
There was a bug once when I press continue it would allow me to go to the phone call but then once I looked at the camera it would go to the home screen PLEASE FIX THE BUG And then I will rate it 5 stars PLEASE
CRASHED Hahaha I just landed my aircraft safely and then boom From an incoming aircraft. I think a rader with the capability to spot other aircraft is much needed. Also add cockpit view. Your game is awesome

Nice Very nice for my kid
Rubbish
Annoying It wount let me sign in..i had to change my password severally  but it still, it wount sign in. Dont waste ur time guys its crap
Old version I don't like the new way at all. I think the old one was better in every way.

Crashes Multiplayer mode crashes as soon as you go to play. Installed on my S6 Edge. Disappointed as I love the card game. I need a refund
Sucks after update I can't upgrade my weapons or armour. Can't restore my health at the resting tent either. But It debits my coins. So frustrating. Pls solve this issue.
Fun It fun but you have to pay for the others
Used it for 7 years n nw i cnt login or reset password
It does not make sense It does not let you set it so it will only opens to your finger print.                   My advice  DO NOT DOWNLOAD piece of junk
I want a Refund 
Nice to play until you happen upon bugs and cheaters And there's a lot of both, making you lose battles you'd otherwise win. The hanging up, not loading and not being able to play, when most events have a limited timeframe is quite annoying as well.
Awesome LOVE IT
Why the low score.. Because I accidentally hit my home button on TAB A tablet and when I tried to go back in, it did not come up to allow me to continue a head to head match.  You need to fix that otherwise the stars are justified.
Have get tile in screen 31 but there is no screen 31 wasted my money good game up till now
Only two games open wish more were open
Hidden objects Way too many ads to make it fun
Takes forever to install After installing you need an additional 140MB download which takes more than the 15 minutes you have to try it out before you can refund the purchase. I gave up after 25 minutes of trying. Lesson learned.
Private table limit I like this game the most but now i dislikes because the limit of private table is upto 20,000 only. I request that the limit must be upto 100,000. So please do something about that so i can resume playing.
Not working. It had some downloading problem. And then it was not supported by my azuz zenfone 5..
Doesn't work. CTD on touch. Moto X 2014. Pretty annoyed that EA is making the same mistakes as tiny studios. GIVE ME A REFUND
Useless application It holds nothing, really useless.
Great Game but... My touchscreen only detect 2 touch points, impossible to complete stop the blood part
The only complaint is the time The time to play three leveLs are 11 HOURS  That is way too long I mean I can't play again till 12 o,clock at night so sucks for us......and plz change the time too 10 minor something I cut wait that long
bug 20 dollar
More trains Great app but really bad of developers to give 1 train only knowing kids will ask parents for the other trains
This game would be better if it didn't keep going to Facebook after each level
I just want to play I am not going to ask friends or buy anything to advance.  I will gladly pay a reasonable one time fee to play as I wish.  Waiting for more lives is ANNOYING Will probably unistall soon.
Won't validate can't open game fix or refund. Very upset 3 year old
Keeps closing I open the app on my sons tablet and it keeps closing after I click on the kitchenliving room garden. 
used to work Was my favourite app. Suddenly does not work. Has the app . been updated
Ugh Well, I swipe across the screen to turn, and it made me either go the opposite way or not turn at all. Plus, when I jump over the water and land on the ground, I go right through. Fix. And there is lag, too.
Crashes The game works perfectly at the main menu, then crashes when loading an episode. I feel like ive wasted my money
I like this app but.......... It doesn't show me how to draw it says check your internet and restart this app but how to restart this app
The app barely works This app will open, but then most of the time it will stop and close. When it does work, it's very slow and I can't save them Please fix and I will rate 5 stars
   
What the heck... Do not understand what is enjoyable about no hint you're playing correctly games. Uninstalled
Mark Doesn't even have Humble Tx
I hate it Worst game ever as soon as I press play it just shows pictures this totally a game that doesn't work all you people that says that it works you are very very wrong you must've been stupid blind
Crap Since 1.8 been very messed up, can't upgrade soldiers or machines, it's asks me to buy 0 gold with 1 celerium in weird coloured text. In fact text all over the game is messed up..
 Useless game
Glitches Do not play this game it has the worse glitches ever  Several people has asked for the glitches to be fixed and they have not fixed them So sad
Freezes to much If they could fix it to were I don't have to take my battery  out every time this game  freezes .. I'd love it ...
Why So i played multi player with my friend and my world called thas world was replaced by his any way to get it back it alzo crashes every 19 minutes  and the world being replaced  its also just his house on a floating block
Guess the movie This game is horrible not only do you have to pay to get hints when you run out of them. The free version you can even download on your phone otherwise I would not expensive 1.99
Riddled With Ads I don't mind ads but this app is severe overkill, played for a while and deleted.
Shayne can't register, something is definitely wrong with this app, you need to get rid of it
Can translate pictures Ever since the recent update in past April and May I'm unable to translate any pictures at all automatically joins all words together  to make not make sense. It also won't recognize all the Spanish text on the picture
I hate it
Wtf It wont open... I thought it would have been a great game...but no matter what i try it wont open...every time i open it it closes itself....Fix it GLU
Ads cause app to freeze This WAS a good game, but in the latest version the game freezes every time it attempts to show an ad, and I have to force close and reopen to keep playing.  Not worth it to keep installed, too much of a headache....Goodbye
Like the worst game ever The players don't even steal the ball from the players even though I go right in em and the title doesn't even match the game
very bad
Fun game but... The ads are just annoying for a paid app. I also don't like receiving notifications without an option to turn them off.
Very poor game Bad graphics. Just try to plagiarize Temple Run. Keep in mind, do something new. Nobody can win by duplicating other successful game. I am uninstalling just now.
I hate this stupid game This he is to stupid they doesn't wait for me I like piano tiles better then this stupid game
Couldn't even start playing because it wanted to connect with my email account but every time I clicked on my email, it just sent me back to the same thing to do it all again. Run around. No thanks.
Can't get through the phone call One huge bug it keeps kicking me out plzs fix it then I will rate 5
Note 4 keeps crashing Not sure what's going on but the app keeps restartingcrashing every minute on my note 4  m1 combo.
This game would not let me get 3 stars when I had a good record and it has so many ads you can't buy the cars because you have to buy them online which makes me mad so I chose a 2 I hate this game it's so stupid whoever made this is a idiot
Fraudulent free delivery Unlike amazon, even if your cart value is 20lakhsgreater than threshold  usually Rs. 499and if one cart item is from another dealer you will be charged shipping charge for that item. What a silly business logic.
Doesn't work My son was so excited to use this app but as soon as we started at the home page was blank and it wont work
Too waste Don't download
Does Not download It won't download at all
Not working This game has always worked and recently every time I open the app, it just closes out. I'd love to have it working again
Fun, but only 12 levels This had some fun levels, but only 12 of them before I had to buy something.
Don't ever download this game This game gives nothing what is advertised
Stupid controls It goes left fine but won't go right enough to take the corners properly waste of money
sucks you have to pay if you wanna do tournaments and other stuff right off the bat..deceiving
This app stinks don't u people know different brands are in different parts of the country How are we supposed to know when from a different area. Really
This is not very good
Charged me 3 times for the same game Charged my debit and phone account a total of 3 times did not say purchased either then days later it gave me the option to download it I emailed them they did not help I will be going to the BBB about this
Stop with the same notifications Yes I know I have the game installed, I do not need my phone to go off every 2 minutes 24 hours a day reminding me that this game is there.
Will not even finish downloading Tried several times and would give up after 20 minutes and getting stuck at the halfway point
DONT INSTALL IT
Wierd The founder must be fool. Because he doesn't know what exactly is a tabla set. The sound varies in a different way between the both tablas. No clarity of the sound. Hate this app.
My game won't even open up after the last update. I would like to see a hero or gem reward for this huge inconvenience
Unfortunately, since updating it to the latest version, it can only record STATIC. Tried reinstalling the app, but it  got worst.  It used to work perfectly on my S3,  but it failed miserably on my Note 3
NO AUTO ROTATION ,NO QWERTY KEYS IN TABLET APP IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH AUTO ROTATION IN MY TAB ,IT SEEMS TO BE ONLY FOR PHONES AND IN THE TAB IT BRINGS THE MOBILE PHONE KEYPAD NOT THE QWERTY, TYPING THE FEEDBACK ITSELF TOOK 10 MINS
Creepy The game is creepy and will randomly say something even though you didn't say anything and it takes a while to respond and repeat  what you say.  It's not   an app that I recommend that you get
power button is gone. stupid yes. the power button is gone since update. that means i am unable to access my slingbox when i am not home. please fix.

Don't seem to work I paid for the upgrade can't find videos is not reading speeds or showing any warnings Galaxy Note 4 edge please I want a REFUND
OK but developer does not support Android The iOS version of this app has many more coloring books available for purchase. The developers of this app clearly do not value their Android user base enough to give them the options available on iOS.
Stupid It really is a dissapointment I read the description and was hoping for something more than what it is
MOGA NOT WORKING I got this game esspesialy to use with my moga BUT IT IS NOT WORKIG I HAVE PAID FOR THIS APP NOW AN AM FURIOUS THAT I HAVE BEEN CONNED LIKE THIS FIX IT

Waste of Time No sound recorded.... I tried many times but... Not working on my Mobile XperiaJ
Glitchy I love the website and had no issue paying for a mobile version. But, it loads slowly or not at all, crashes frequently, and I have to resign in each time. Disappointing.

Dark souls meets temple run. I love tomb raider, but am finding it very difficult to like this game. Touch response is slow and sluggish and half the time you can't see an obstacle quick enough to react to it anyway.
no more mpoints MPoints had been down. Finally got new questions, but the fun is gone. Bring back the mpoints or I'm out.
No longer works I rarely let my young one play on the tablet or phone. This game her favorite out of two. And no longer works since update. Unhappy toddler.

NO GROUP CHAT My classmate and I wanna chat together and there is no way to do so..please add back group chat
Useless App With Book cab feature even you can't open the app of uber, ola, tfs. It will just bring you to the play store.  The offer discount are just the referral code to earn money. No use of this app.
Not a good game You can only paint 3 nails and then you have to get the full version to get everything else. Thats bull crap
Its a great game but I am fed up of having to reinstall it and losing all I have done..have reinstalled this game 3 times today already ..not reinstalling it anymore going to find another game..fed up now
Marsha Fun, could use better instructions on use of help pieces, had to figure out most on my own or stumbled onto them.
Don't waste your time App doesn't work. It's now 1633 and I am searching for the next train on my route. It gives  me the first trains of the day what I am looking for. The ads make it virtually unusable
Won't open Comes to the screen and says loading and goes no further
In app purchases inside a paid game Guess that is fine when you get the money but not others. Refunded
Fake apps It show pass word is not cottect and change password is not working plz frnd dont install it fake apps . not support recharge 
Princess  makeover for girls This game looks fun to me

Token bs Can't reload now even after signing out
Game doesn't even start Connecting to server WTF  I verified my age and after that its loading and loading and loading. This game is taking too much time to connect to a server.
Doesn't work. Stupid cheap rip off game that constantly froze my phone. Pathetic intrusive add pop ups also make game unplayable.
Doesnt work well The apps music and talking do not work well sometimes scrambles. App quits working alot. Wish I would have stuck with the free version.
Kinda done with your new found Fakeness. ESPN very disappointed you think the bravest athlete is one with lots of money and sexual confusion.  That is bravery  Cutting back on you.
Some of the keys don't play Dissapointed keys will not play on sony z2 xperia d,b and f keys have no sound. Please fix
Game runs great but none of the subtitles or txt shows up so its impossible to know what choices I am making. I am playing on a s3 but like I said the game runs smooth so if they fix the txt I will give it a five star.
This game is nothing but a money racket. This kvk is only a means to get you to spend money to replace what you lost. You can never grow because of these kvk events.One of the sorriest game I have ever played. Don't waste your time or money
It doesnt give you the free credits..
CRAP It's a cool idea but constantly tells me the GPS is inaccurate and GPS lost. Was considering buying the premium but if the free one can't even keep my GPS accurately not gonna pay 10 bucks.
Not my cup of tea but its okay
Very poor. Functionally it kinda works but you only get half of the menu icons along the bottom and there is no Android Menu button even though the app tells you to use it to create favorites. Very poor standard of build in this app.
It's a store first and a game second I sincerely hope this whole F2P model goes down in flames.
Ads block buttons You can't proceed to next menus or games cause adverts are in the way of buttons. Really How stupid
It sucks This game sucks it only lets me play mini games and when i try to get the girl into the emergency room it tells me its not working. Its like why make a game  if its not even going to let you play So if i were you i wouldn't download it.
Horrible I got this because it labeled the notes. I thought it would help my six year old who is learning to play the piano. Unfortunately the notes were labeled WRONG Useless
Hangs on s3 Poor interface
Can't play As soon as I got on it disconnected me and before I even got on an ad came and it also disconnected me. Please fix and I'll rate 5
It is just rubbish after few days of service. It does not work. Don't buy it. Don't buy it.
Worst....these guys just copied from subway surfers....don't waste your time on this
Keeps crashing If it wasn't crashing nearly every single time I try to play it, it actually would be pretty good. Until it's fixed, one star it is.
I want my money back I start to download the game and then it tells me there's an error and there's not option to refund
App doesn't work App doesn't work after installing new version
Woooooooooow nice game
Boo x pop

Bad gameplay The only play that works is the long pass, you can't get past them on a run play, and the receivers don't catch the ball on a short pass I thought this game would be fun but it sucks, really disappointed.
In app purchasing It runs but it freezed. I prest it as fast as I could... and it's still not working. DUMBEST THING EVER

Please fix the game The game is brilliant but keeps crashing and sends a message stating unfortunately the amazing spider man stopped.. I Uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times, still keeps crashing. Either fix or refund me.
No maps I purchased this app about 1 year ago and thought that was it. Well now it is asking for me to purchase it again. Uninstalling it now. Waze far better.
Give me a refund This game is the worst game ever I want my money back
Horrific Terrible. It suspends every account I make. Why I made a mistake on one account. And it won't give me another chance. Deleting this right now. em3 is scum
On galaxy s6 edge Not the best voip app. Doesn't integrate with phone call log or contacts, crashes most of the time while in use or switching between WiFi and 4G.

No notifications I never know when someone calls me, no notification and phone doesn't ring. It's been this why for a year, this app is not reliable at all. Needs tons of work and their's no why to call magic jack
Controls are...not so good. The game looks great but the controls make it almost impossible to control a ship or character. They aren't responsive at all. Overly sensitive sometimes and unresponsive other times. Not consistent.
Loved it... until yesterday. It had been a fun game... until yesterday. It quit working and now the app tries to open but can't. Sad as I enjoyed it.  FIX IT PLEASE
Update force closes. Since the update every time I open the game it force closes right away. I just spent 20 on coins and now I can't even play the game. Fix and will give 5 stars. Galaxy s5
Overpriced I wouldn't recommend buying the additional puzzles. Way overpriced  The entire app is 'free app' quality.
Piece of crap game. You will reach certain levels that are unbeatable. Since collors of the balls are generated at random you may never get lucky. Stuck at lvl 113. Uninstall
Too many pop up adds.

Boring my baby
Add more animals and biomes. The game gets boring after a while. Add more biomes and animals. Also, make the map bigger.
Does not work...the web link needs to be updated i guess..
Hate it. I cannot even read my messages.
Very Bad Support Can finally play after getting new phone. Shame on the developers for not even responding when I could not play on previous phone. Obviously all they care about is making money. Wish Google or whoever would ban developers like this.
DOES NOT WORK What a total waste of money.  Nothing on this app works.
the new graphics sucks big time. It's difficult to differentiate symbols. Also maybe some of the old expansions groups should be included on the app now. Also I want online matches like in iOS.
Not working on Android 5 Used to be fine until my nexus 7 updated to android 5. Please fix
Meh, I recently have taken interest in anime and mangas but I really hoped this app would have stories to read for free, ugh I heard a ton of good reviews from friends but was disappointed

Confused about the maps I bought the topo map version so I could get the trail maps, but all it shows is an area map, no trails. Not even a trail head. What's the point Trying to find help or faq online.
Constant Crashes Ever since the update July 13th can't connect to server, failed connections to host. Was an okay game for the day and a half I had installed... Hopefully they'll fix or its back to the play store 
Ads, too much. Also, asking for a rating before you can even use the app Bullshit. The fact that it did not work for me on over 4 devices might be my custom ROM's fault
Sucks
Doesn't work at all The game doesn't work at all It loads half way then freezes  would like a refund
I cannot register a new account Nothing happens when I try to register myself
Crashes are ruining the game Really enjoy this game. Was about 1000 in the first one and it seems every few online matches it freezes and I lose the game and a war spirit. Will change rating when it's fixed.
Went to the recruit part first time playing the game and it keeps crashing at that same part every single time. I am using a Kyocera hydro life

DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS. IT DOESN'T WORK. DOESN'T EVEN GET PAST LEVEL 1. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. COMPLETE WASTE OF 35 MEGABYTES.
Had to download it twice..... so damn bad I'm angry I had to download it twice makes makes me angry to because the lag problems are major I'm so angry.....
Broken on Lollipop Widgets are not resizable on lollipop. The 4x2 stupidly defaults to 3x2 why which you must resize to 4x2. Even this is no longer possible. With some more investment this app could be great. Right now its very unpolished.
Not working Game crashes or stops working every time I try to open it on my Droid Turbo.
Well This is freaking junk dose.not connect to Google says no files to download and then if you try to backup bookmarks says no bookmarks found then if you email this guy who made this junk he will not reply
Widget broken since last update My widget deleted itself from the home and when I put it back now it always shows Auckland even though I have Wellington selected as default
Latest update It was working fine til the latest update. I try to open the app and it closes on me right away. Uninstalling if I can't use it anytime soon. 
Beast quest It would be a lot better if you didnt have to pay for new worlds

If Ill give it a 5 star if you fix this. It works well but sometimes it didnt recognize my strokes or touch. How can i replace my highscore if i die in the middle of the run or even in the initial. Thnks
You cant choose letters that you want, it's like they're greyed out. But it gives me the same 5 letters to choose from Kinda lame.. was excited to play this but now i can't  
Wheel of Fortune It freezes to much and sometimes after I spin the word bank comes up with no available letters for me to pick needs to be fixed
Keeps pausing I never even got a chance to play the game because it pauses right in the middle .
Doesn't work On HTC one m8
Lag Needs performance improvements. Too much lag, and it does make the game difficultpractically unplayable
Sabse jyada bekar game don't install it totally time waste and ak se kam star dena tha
Used to be really good now not working.. Just see the binary mill logo then black screen..
Not the real sound Slow and fake voice
Eh Glitchy and to repetitive it gets boring after awhile. Now emilys taste of fame and sequels are great. Never gets boring.
Eh Li ke aviary as a whole... but these extra packages seem like scams.
Great App but  Always consumes a lot of Power This App runs in the background even After you Exit the App so it keep draining the Battery. If they fix the power consumption issues Magic Jack would be a great up to call US  Canada for Free
Can no longer use home2 launcher alongside solo launcher, that needs to be the default but I keep getting the error failed to set solo launcher.
I wish I could play it but you can't see anything while playing it because it's practically all black hopefully they fix it.

Wont download Paid for it.. download got to a megabyte left and stopped.. refunded and retried.. same deal..and now wont let me refund so im stuck with a purchase that wont download.
Useless Iss and comet lovejoy in completely the wrong position WTF
Latest updates are no good I cannot open any pictures or view any videos. Seems like it takes forever to reloadupdate the posts. I've tried uninstalling it and reinstall it with no luck. Seems like each update makes it worse than the last.
All I see is ads Possibly the worst game I've ever played, every 5 seconds there's an ad pop up, and you have to work around the ones that are permanently on the screen. Don't waste your time with this one.
Download paused I bought a game which i can't play apparently, i want to go on second stage, but there is content that should be downloaded, and it constantly says download paused even though I'm on wifi.... Fix it please
Good but This game is good but it makes me so frustraded. And you could add in some new things like you get more money to purchase things.
Ok Theek th
U need to get your shit  together I doesn't let me login unless I subscribe to a fucking free app
Doesn't load on tablet Don't buy yet it doesn't load its just a black screen and forced closing all the time on my lenovo 8 tab I'm very disappointed even sent report and nothing from the developers after 2 weeks
BLACK... I PLAYED IT ONCE THEN IT WAS ALL BLACK
Doesn't Work Every time I open the game. After it says connecting.... The game closes automatically.                                                     I will rate fairly if u fix it
too slow Lose the animated background and try to grab some performance back
Worst pay to play game Paid money for the game and every time I roll the dice and move the game exits. I open it again and its the computers turn it rolls and moves then game exits again. This needs to be fixed now or I want a refund for this game.
Lot of advertisement
Boring We go to now a new game... Such poor English.  Can't buy a vowel during game. Have too wait till I guess .   uninstalling
Boring Not what I expected. I found it very boring and tedious. Uninstalled it after a week.
Still sucks Thank you for a real non standardized message. Keep your chips. I play alot at real casinos and never seen 1 color come up  14 times in a row.  But I did raise the raiting to 2 stars since you repyed with a real message.
Issues Another update and another failure Fun game but irritating when for the past several weeks seeing updates but still seeing more server checking and server timeouts then game play
Never gives me any side off...but i love it ...
Entertaining, yet incredibly repetitive I often find myself skipping the dialog. It doesn't mean a thing.
Why it doesn't work in HK I can download but cannot use, cest pas vrai...... very disappointed
Fixes are required for enjoyment The game frequently closes, erasing all progress that has been made. The game also lags at several points during gameplay as well as cut scenes. This game is fun, but it is rare when Eric does not occur.
Problems not fixed. Nexus 4 Upgrade to Android 5 brings new problems, highlights that interface has never been properly finished. Sent in screen grab some time ago, no action so I'm downgrading.
What happened I updated it and my game wont start and all that is happening is that it goes on to the software screen and then it crashes. Please fix it this is my favorite game

Doesn't work I created a skin and uploaded it and chose browse and said that's not a skin silly
Awful Unplayable Controls This might be a good game... But it's impossible to play due to imprecise touch controls. Trying to press the same button 10 times to make something happen is ridiculous. I wish I could get my money back. DON'T BUY THIS GAME
Waste of time data money. Like focus strike block
Does it work in canada Won't let me request a taxi.  It detects my location fine but won't let me request a taxi as the button to click is greyed out.

They say they fixed the black screen issue but they haven't. You can't even access the settings when it black screens
Sucks I liked the game but it kept forcing close on me so i uninstalled it
Mixed feelings Gameplay is good and enjoyable. Shadow casting from light sources is quite annoying. I understand the concept but it really ruins game altogether.
Fix it please It loads up the videos...but they won't play   yes, i'm on a strong WiFi connection too
absolute crap. first game I have ever paid for and the worst pay outs ever.
Review Better than was, but I still gave 1 star until you update iNoty

Doesnt work on SG prime After purchase, I only get a check license prompt when i first tried to run. Very dissapointing.
Uganda is not included on the database so I cannot use it.
Hated it It is stupid
Take to long to win any coins. One minute  you are up with a lot of coins and the next they keep taking them away. Wins are few and between and don't pay out enough. Bonus spin take for ever to happen.
I need a refund
Horrible game Impossible to get new gear, putting is impossible. Needs a bigger perfect swing stopping point will be unistalling very disappointed
No play option Keeps asked me to purchase
My daughter played it once. I paid 7.99 as a treat for my daughter to unlock all the characters and she played one time and it won't open the app anymore.

Hate too much Didnt working
Anybody else I have tried and tried I hate to leave a bad rating but the first thing I wanted were the webcams can't seem to get it to work no matter what I do. I will gladly change my rating if it works. For now uninstall
Great but... You won't get a 5 until you make it shield controller compatible. Please make it so, and I will do the same. Thank you
Just AD'S
Paid to download a game that doesn't work. Why is that only certain letters are able to be chosen when playing the game I want a refund. Not worth downloading if you can't actually play the game.
Unauthorised for my Android Device Typical EA takes money and does not work on  Galaxy Tab 2. EA  explain
Saying no internet connection Either WiFi or data 8 out of 10 times will not open, saying need internet connection Please fix.

VIP I see the creators still don't care this app is broke
Not connecting to opel corsa c 2005 model
Make it realistic Should be the same chance as a real slot machine to make winning actually mean something with perhaps earn coins over time to play or option to buy
Its just a time waste.. sometimes you loose 80,00,000 but not even can declare one time.. you will not get better cards..
No write to external SD card Love the app but like others have pointed out it still does not write to an external xd card.
Not very interactive I wish there was more to do within each routine but it is a very simple app and my two year old was bored quickly.
Kak app. Not recording my trips.  Previous version was a little better.  Do not install this version.  Many people having problems with it.   Samsung s4 mini not compatible.
Doesn't work Crashed on opening emailed no refund or reply
On WiFi Only I can only send n receive when on WiFi I have try everything and nothing it wasn't like this before tho.. two stars because of the good variaty of games

not to mention the stupid ads, when com. reaches 96 or 97 then rolls the dice, gets 56 and wins
Force close problem  Ever since system update on Galaxy S6, it force closes immidiately after opening ap. Was a favorite for years now doesn't work.  Frowny face
False advertisement The video you have for this game on Facebook is nothing like the game. I wanted to play the game that was in the video
Modern sniper I don't like how you have to pay for energy before you move to level 5

E uma droga So ten opsoes de treinmo e uma putas
Last update ruined it I loved this app, but now it locks my S3 up so hard I must pull the battery. This happens when a call comes in or I mess with Waze too much.  Made me sad to uninstall it.
Please fix the lag This would be an Amazing game if you could fix the lag 5 stars for less lag
Unknown error Ever since my phone updated to kit kat I can't install it.  Unknown error code 24 is what I get.  I can't install it.
Problem so uninstalling My OK Google feature stopped working.. And the problem is preventing mic to be open so it can't listen and hence it can't respond...
Ads Rated one star because too many ads.  It's  completely asinine.  Every time you do anything an add pops up. I understand the purpose of ads but this is too much .
Special actions vanish After collecting a special action, they will vanish at various times for human players. AI opponents never lose their actions which makes it nearly impossible to ever win.
No Do not get this game. Al the time there is an add and it does not do wat you want to.
Still Needs Work The AI seems to be stronger with the update but is still pretty weak nonetheless. Constantly crashes in campaign. Has potential but still needs lots of work before developers can justify cost of this game.
Very good Its very interesting
Blackjack Dealing is ridickulously throttled and controlled. Dealer hits 21 or blackjack 87, especially during crucial hands. Only the stupid may apply.
What I look at it and I'm like it's solitare. What can go wrong So I download it and opened it, and it makes a sound that ripes my ear in half. Then, when I try to actually play it, it ignores almost everything that I tell it to do. So yeah.
Used to be good Constantly crashes when I try to open the app, crashes after every round I play.
I wouldn't even give this game one star, every time I start a game on a table they kick me off and I have to use MY chips to buy back in again. Really sucks Fix it
Can not move I could not go anywhere stuck        HEY HELP ME

QD hnlich schrottig wie frher Studi VZ Die App wirkt im Vergleich mit anderen Quiz Apps vorsintflutlich. Schlimm ist es gegen so viele Betrger antreten zu mssen. So macht es keinen Spa. Nutze nur noch QuizUp.

Sad I love this app. It's true that the purchased app shouldn't have adds, but I can deal with that. What I don't love is the fact that it crashes so much I can't even play. Fix the crashes or refund my money.
Closes immediately after launch Used to work before lollipop update.  Now it closes and goes back to home screen immediately after launch.

Its meh.. This version feels very bland and the game even on 2million is just way too short even with 4 players..  Still it was worth playing a few times but original monopoly is far better.
This is a fun game, we can meet a lots of friends but spent a lots of money. If you don't buy rubies you won't get everything. The more time the more greedy is this game

Portrait mode only Entertaining, but having to hold in portrait mode to play, when my Nexus 10 stand is landscape, gets old fast. Would rate higher if it had landscape mode.
It's a fun app. But I get stuck on question 95 and nothing I do will get me past it. I tried looking up the answer and still didn't get me past it, I'm uninstalling and reinstalling and it didn't help. Still stuck on 95... bad app.

Can't add individuals, only communities. A bug in the app right now prevents adding people, only can add communities. Using a browser to add, then going back to the app does not register that I have added anyone except communities.

Useless I've tried this on 4 phones and 1 tablet over a year or two.  The app is completely brokenthe pointer randomly jumps at times greater than 90 degrees.  Tried all the settings designed to fix issues with no help.
My son was using this every day but all of a sudden it stopped working and sayss I don't have the correct hardware with a black screen
Thanks 5 Thanks
Awful Words are way too hard on the easy level. Most words I have never even heard of before
Too slow gameplay It's still too slow in matches. The speed should match the one from previous version. Football manager 2014 is by far the best. Should reconsider when creating 2016.
Keeps crashing This app is great when it works but  when it constantly crashes it gets very frustrating and will use less. Please fix ASAP
Still buggy App works well but restarts to frequently in the background. With the screen off it siphoned 40 of my battery. Please fix
Faulty app Sony Z2, you can't build properties as the app stops allowing you to scroll around the board after a few rolls. Do not buy.

Don't update game I loved the old skipbo with the leader board.  This is almost the same but definitely do not enjoy it as much as I did the old one.  Wish they would undo the update
Not right I have never lost this much. I have played in several casinos including Vegas. The dealer should not be winning so much and instead should be busting more.
Loadcrazy Dave shop It takes forever to load compared to ios and the items in crazy Dave's car are way more expensive than on ios app. good game just badly delivered to android.
Like this app
Needs a nonmisogynistic Australian version. Relies heavily on American terminology and spelling, so bear this in mind when comparing your scores with others. Also, it loses a star for linking dumb and broad.
No options Does not give you the option as to where you want to place score. The undo option is gone to fast. Uninstalling
Game sucks The graphics suck,the animations suck and the price rust for pc is better than this way better than this I want a refund this game is 3.80 do not buy this app
This game focuses too much on spending money, and their new update doesn't work. Also their pvp search filter doesn't work, so basically you will have to fight two lvl's higher than what your troops are trained for. This is not a game for me.
Terrible. This garbage crashes super laggy now I have to download Clean Master. Like seriously. My Tablet gon' laggy. Advice Change this garbage,dont wanna be rude.

Loved it until it broke Black screen with button TAP HERE and DEBUG in lower left corner.  Tapping button does nothing.  Been playing a long time and don't want to reinstall and loose points.  Please fix
Horrible idea to put adds on baby game So your idea of getting rid of ads is to make us pay for some stupid app we don't want Uninstalling there's plenty of better apps for kids that are totally free without stupid ads
Family Guy quest for stuff For 10 days I have not been able to log on.. And I'm not the only one that seems like hundreds of people have the same issue.. Do not download this game

Turns off every few minutes It used to be great, but now it won't stay on for more than a minute or two
.... I do like the game. But, when you put your opponents health down to 0 the game should end automatically instead of them lowering their health. And when you KO them first it's not fair that your opt still wins

Game is fun, but if the people your playing don't respond you have to forfeit the game to get rid of them and then you loose points. going to uninstall
No longer able to play. Rarely logs in after update.  If it does log in, every action takes minutes to complete because it's communicating with network.
Unbearable amount of ads Cannot enjoy the game even bit, just coz of ads. You are not even giving time for any1 to like the game, by bombarding with ads. Then who would think of paying One of d worst game I've installed yet
Froze on me After reaching level 40,  it froze. Had to reload and start at level one. Very disappointed. Also had paid for extra lives etc,  and lost those as well after reloading.  To bad for the crash and freezing,  locking issues.
Don't waste your money Lags and is not user friendly. Its worthless. Too difficult and glitchy for kids and adults.  I wish I could get a refund.
Poor game app Still so many issues even if updates... No such improvement... Waste of time and downloading for this useless app...
BEWARE high data usage The app chews thru data if you have a fast connection. On my 4g connection getting about 3318mbps downup, it used 97MB of my data. There are no warnings in the app about this or settings to limit the usage. Watch out
             .

This sucks Don't waste your time. You get stuck in this free spin bullshit and can't get out of it. No instructions on how to use the app. Not difficult initially but then here comes the free spin. Just skip this one.

Questions are wrongly constructed UPSC would not ask such questions and hence level has to be increased. Only for amateurs. Wont help in clearing exams
My contacts...not my interest in game It is more concerned about my contacts knowing about the game than allowing me to open a game. Its worse than Facebook.
Too long to load. It takes way to long to load before a player gets to hit the ball and the game sometimes just gets out completely Fix them problems and a five star coming your way
It won't let me take off the nail polish I keep pressing back but nothing happens the nail polish just stays there
New update ruins controls I love this game, but the new controls are obtrusive and difficult to use.  I would have much preferred they would update with the soul of chaos dungeon like the IOS version.
Retarded This is not scary it got all you stupid idiots but not me
The framerate, even in VOID cinema is very poor. Too much drift even after advanced configuration.
Fake app Doesn't work
It is a bullshit game and it is lame who every are girls or boys will real be lame and bullshit
wow but one thing its good and all but at least make it look more interesting for a smart guy is that ok

Deleting this game. Does not allow you to change colours, also some sections you just cannot pass as wrong colours come out and you will never pass and for that reason I'm deleting this game.
Crap Both in good at all
Jackpot party slots Wish I could give them a 5. For a game that doesn't pay anything. They have these games set tighter then they have them set in the casino. And you can get your money back here all you get is s     .
Evil ESPN...JENNER is NOT Courageous ESPN is awarding evil as good.  I won't use their app or watch their events.
It's a good but.... It's too easy you just click on the screen without any intelligent and you can win how is that. Another problem there only 9 levels, really
Waste game Don't waste ur MB .. This games is totally mother fk ..
Pity about the lag
Not user friendly The regular pga app is much better.  This app allows me to select favorites but I still have to search for them.  Why bother
No idea Massive Queen fan yet can't really give a rating as it will not let me try it out. The screen keeps telling me to turn up the volume, which I've tried but still asks me to turn up volume. Not a happy bunny,
Latest update has ruined the app Since latest update online play doesn't work at all on my Nexus7. Previously 'advanced Acol bidding' was crap but at least online play worked although it was necessary to reboot my tablet before running the app.
Black screen After the loading screen, everything was black i tried exiting the game but it made my phone freeze. I will give it 5 stars if the problem is fixed. I really want to play the game
Doesn't work right. App turns off my ringer and crashes when I try to take a HDR photo.

Connecting to Desktop Doesnt finish the song. Automatically leaving the room 
Just plain annoying I love the programme, but this game is nothing like it. Other than the pointless counter, the rest is just plain awful. Questions are overly complicated and long winded. What a waste of money.
It didn't work The game is poop
Why so inappropriate It showed her private part We are kids I don't think kids should play this
It only has two lame levels that make you want break your phone when you mess up. There's better apps that cost a buck
It is terrible. Do not get it. Face offs are impossible and the user goalie couldn't save a volleyball.
This game is seriously messed up since last update. Cant play it most of the time. Freezes or kicks me off the game. Lost 30 energy and two cups of coffee because of the freezing. Used to be such a good game to play
Black screen How is it legal to charge someone 2 pounds for a black screen Very disappointed 5 year old and angry dad.........want a refund 
Limited Very little vocabulary for fruits
Black Screen When the game finished loading and giving the options between 8 month or 4 years it went black screen. Though sounds still can be heard
Says not rooted I have a moto g boost Mobile. And I bought this app and the checker. Not realizing it would not show me how to tether my phone. Please help.

Controls Are unresponsive and awkward for just three moves.
 
AWFUL Camera and targeting are very clumsy and difficult to control.  Very frustrating  impossible to enjoy
Avatar deaktivieren Den blauen Kreis fand ich schner warum kann man mit der PremiumVersion den Avatar nicht wieder entfernen
It won't open Every time I open it, it crashes right away. I can't even get my money back.

Eh
No KitKat support on Shield It might well be a good game but seeing as my nvidia shield is running 5.0 it's not opening. Not too disappointed though as long as the devs patch in 5.0 support x3
Horrible It wouldn't even load all the activities. When I pressed invitation maker it said sorry couldn't load. Then the screen turned totally black. If I could I would've rated it nothing. It was that bad.
Cost This is a good game but all things r so costly pls do something  about it .I'm waiting for an update pls
Locked up my phone Could not use my phone screen stopped w I rking could not turn my phone off and app never worked
I hate it I try and play the game and it keeps going off
IMPOSSIBLE  LEVEL 34 Seriously difficult to get past this level. I can't see how to get past.
Cute idea, junk app. Crashed my phone during the very first call. It even restarted itself
Bad bad This app sucks, connection is always bad, tried to watch it through the Website but it redirects me to watch on the app. Really bad Samsung...
Horrible worst game ever It is very slow and boring. Not fun. Terrible idea to do it. God who ever did this game is a completely jerk. God it is very very boring

You can't do anything there's nothing to see
Ridiculous apps Give me one logical reason, why should I pay you for manga Don't even bother to download, it's a waste of time and data plan.
Its not bad. It gives you too few free chips. You play for 20  30 min then you have to wait till the next day to play again. They give you some chips every few hr but its only enough for one or two buy ins.
Private table limit I like this game but i dont like this game bcoz private table limit are so small ...increas the private table limit...
Horrible Everything else is fine its free but it hangs up the call for you , the  call can last for a good five minutes before it hangs up, lastly it has an irritating noise . Fix It or Ill delete it  One or the other your choice.
DONT DOWNLOAD It shows a video of an ad every three times and it doesn't use all the name of the cartoon or movie and it spells them incorrectly hateit
It's stupid It won't let me pick the tools I want.
THIEFS All these games do is beg beg beg you to spend money. When u finally break down and buy coins all they do is steal them. You can hardly get free spins or bonuses on any of them. I would like to give this a zero....
SO BAD very long, it makes me wait. This game seems ugly, many bad comments about this game. perhaps, you have to repair the damage or delay in this game. so that the users feel comfortable, and make this game great. and perhaps, not discard quota
Likes keep dissapearing Great app and most preffered, but likes keep getting lost and messed up Please fix extremely annoying
Deserves 0 star. Seriously bro Thousands of bloons crossing that line and still opponent isn't losing a LIFE No matter how infinite cash you have or the best monkeys you will lose. Fix it or 1 star is what you will be getting.
My friend and i both downloaded this app and tried using it today, had lots of problems  Gps wasnt picked up and difficult to navigate app .
Freaking ads People don't waste your money with this game. They charge us to play, and charge the companies they are playing ads for. It interrupts the game very often which is very annoying. Freaking capitalists idiots
Yah I guess is was fun but all u get to do is fly around
Wont work Hey i hot the galaxy s 5 and wenever i click on the app it says it has unfortunately syped working. Ill change it to 5 stars when its fixed
Good but no better then free Live wallpaper does not work aso can't make the battery icon and notifications green

Extremely intrusive Ads The ads in this game are very highly intrusive. It looks like it would be a fun game to play, but when a 30 second ad pops up at the start of a race and there's no way to skip it, the game becomes unplayable.
Hate it Do not get old one I hate it you can't even personalize it and they don't do what they promise I am deleting it and all of you idiot's should to PLEASE FIX AND I WILL GIVE FIVE STARS
Mohammad I have Xperia z1with lolipap any working
Awful I think the RA would do well to to reconsider getting someone else to produce a decent app for them in the future.Leaderboard is awful.
Honestly This game is great and all but what the actual Frick You have to wait 3hours for 3passes that sucks. The game itself is amazing but the creators need to make it 1hours wait like seriously
it takes a long time to load, my 4 yo is a patient little girl but she said it's boring and she loves peppa pig
Not functional for Droid Turbo Just bought this and the menu button doesn't work My guy just moves right. So I can't see my equipment or stats or do anything which renders this unplayable. Refund please

Fun but crashes a lot As many others have said. Not sure why it needs the huge download but I'm glad I only paid a quarter. Hope it will update and fix the crashes.
Rigged Most rigged game I've ever seen. If you play vs computer it will yahtzee ever game if not twice. You might get one every 5th game if your lucky

No longer works with S4. Needs fix. This used to be a great game until I tried to download it on to my Samsung galaxy s4 and realized that you are unable to use the last row on the screen. Now, sadly, the game is pretty much useless.
Blah U should unlock at least 2 rooms  And the bathroom is so small

What happened Performance has gotten significantly worse since the last update and the owned books section is much less intuitive to use now. Please fix.
This game sucks. I haven't shot anything. You should call it rock toss.

FCB Baercelona.   CHAMPIONS
Passenger  Crash As soon as I mark an item as Passenger the app crashes. When I go back to the My Trips section I cannot scroll down, it just keeps crashing. Now I am unable to retrieve my list of trips.
Empty Promises Was promised a web interface in the fall of 2012 and we are still waiting... The developer now ignores any request or inquiry regarding the web interface.
This is really beginning to feel like more data collection. And that's no surprise. .  Why earn coins when you can't  use them

Not updated consistently What have you not updated the schedule I have in area 5b stage 1, 2 and 3 for the same time but in your app it only has stage 1. Unreliable going to uninstall. Gridwatch from news24 is the way to go.
Crash and burn Opened and ran time 1st time I used. Won't get any further than the menu now

Good on my nexus 7, doesn't work on my s3 Please fix developer. I'm disappointed that it doesn't work on such a well known device as the Samsung galaxy s3 Love this game but  can't play, please fix for 5 rating.
Quality of the recorded sound. I don't know why but when I record sound and then play it in normal mode the quality is too bad. I don't know if it is set like that in the app. Cause when I use my normal sound recorder app everything is fyn.
Very poor..wow
   ...     
Menu doesn't work Every time I try to press the menu button all it does is move my character right. I can't equip anything or do anything.
BOOO I'm just buying this because it said on this game called avakin life so if I get this app I will get 111 coins
Not really worth the money, needs major improvements. Real racing 3 is better and that is free
Spam Unsubscribing from the constant premium membership schlepping was painful, still not sure if I was successful... I want the interval training only, would be good app if I could hide the excess crap and wasn't hassled
Hate it Why  the  other Prince  locked   so I give  it 
Multiple devices... Games alot of fun, but the video ads are obnoxious, and I can't use my account on multiple devices phone  tablet.
Buggy It won't go past the first tutorial level then it starts to flicker as if it wants me to have a seizure. Uninstalling before it does
You'd figure the magazine release of the first of the month of release would mean a new patch once a month to at least release new content... Which would have been amazing.
I would give it no stars but I had to give one. Game wouldn't even open when I downloaded it and it kept taking me back to my homescreen. Stupid game. Don't get it
wow never seen so many ads. wth is wrong with devs. if you are so poor don't make a game I guess, geez.
Lost everything I had to uninstall the game and reinstall to get the update and lost my entire account. Does anyone know where the support page is cause I dropped money into this game and would like to continue doing so.

Need machetes. Can't do anything without the machetes so what's the point Also  earning the free machetes doest work. The Surveys are all scams and you don't get the machetes for doing them. Reported problem 22xs and no response.
24 hour glitch This has been one of my favorite games however I am also stuck on the endless map for 4 days. Everytime I open the app, the 24 hour clock starts over. I would say 4 days is a bit longer than 24 hours... Please fix this
Menu doesn't work I try to change the settings and it shows up way in the corner, I try to move the settings so I can see it and it just goes back so far in the corner I can't see anything

Change on pinning I used to only have to click once to pin something to my board. Now it seems like I have to do it 23 times to pin something. Whatever was changed is not good. Prior to whatever change was made, I would have given you 5 stars.

Horrible Design The controls are super glitchy, not to mention that the gameplay and objective are unclear. Got really boring really fast
Stupid game Was interesting at the first didn't even pass 5 stages it was sucking. Developer has designed the vehicles which doesn't go in the hills I can't even choose the map o have drive on the default map which vehicles doesn't go. Waste of time.
Network fail After i updated the game it wont let me in constantly saying network error, will change rating if fixed thanks or uninstall...
Uses to much data Program used 28 Meg of my data plan in an hour of playing. This isn't an online game. What is this program doing. I don't use that much in 3 hours of web surfing, I can see using a meg or 2 but this is ridiculous.
Good game but fed up of blinking adds, uninstalling the game
Best kids story I hated it cause it was so crap
Sucks I can't use the compare function. It keeps telling me I need to upgrade, when I have. Even worse they won't allow a refund. Stay away from this, use Ubersense instead.

Disappointed Half the levels are exactly the same as the free version, so you need to do 50 levels you've already done to even start the new levels you paid for.
Won't open I wasted time and money getting this app .It won't open. Fix it now.My phone is Samsung galaxy trend plus.

I loved it before it stopped working. It crashed on chapter transitions over and over. After the patch it also did so a few times, but now it just stopped working. I it tells me I have no network connection.
         
I thought about giving this only one star, but I do like a lot of the things you can do on it. However, I'm very annoyed that after I exit the game and then open it up like 30 minutes later, I have to go back and get the free things over again.
it doesnt even let me play it says that the game has crashed every time i open it up
A Google User My kid loves the app but it will not install on his tablet Galaxy Tab 4 8.0
Ads Everything is an ad or a mini transaction. Worst mobile game I've seen in a while.
          
uninstalling because my 2 year old grandson needs help with digging. Not very impressed
Stay tuned Its still downloading...love the lite version but hope this one will let me save my builds
Needs some updates... App keeps freezing up. Slow to refresh. Outbox messages just keep trying to send for a while. Need to have a resend button in the outbox phase. Samsung Note 4 ATT.
USELESS Will not connect to server...then says sorry bingo has shut down.... useless. On Galaxy S5 Active with full bar strength in home WiFi
WHY DO YOU WANT ME TO RATE I LIKE THE APP BUT I HATE YALL

Payouts are decent but the new machines i unlock will not download.  I am only able to play the first machine
Hard Even in practice mode this game is ruthless.  It beats me in less than 6 moves every time.
Crashes Whenever I look at my past trips the app crashes.  Also not linking to website
Useless Why making this game its worst, sometimes it control by itself, graphics is good but atlist make both teams jersy coloured...

Terrible Not only is the interface not user friendly, but the app doesn't work well. Tried scanning a QR code on a package and it completely failed. Same code was recognized in two seconds by QR Droid. Uninstalling now.
Ever since the new update I cannot view stories, it says there is a connection error when I am fully connected to the internet. And a lot of the time in wont load my own snaps I receive and if it does it takes hours
Why all the permissions for Why would a child's app need thus much permission It was a mistake to install.
Seriously Its not even letting me open this stupid app
Unhappy Very unhappy. Downloaded the app and opened it and instead of graphics i got white boxes. Uninstalled and reinstalled  the app and still the same. Not good for a paid app.
Galaxy Note Edge Slows my phone down to almost unusuability. Also runs very hot. Reformatted 2 times and only installed the launcher. 17.00 down the drain.
crashes immediately on m8 if you spend 5 on a game you think it would at least open .. thanks for nothing .. at least thank me for buying air
Don't buy This game is not worth it It's not like real lax at all. In real life my goalie doesn't stand 10 feet Away from the net. Also, very laggy game. Dont buy. It steals your money

Keeps telling me no internet connection.  Unable to use
Wtf ' I can't see my save anymore but I still have Google achievements.. Wtf pls recover my account No, I didn't use cloud, but that's not the point, it shouldn't be my responsibility, to stop saves randomly disappearing

Booo The game had a lot of annoying guys.
Not working on Note 4 Black screen and keeps freezing

Great free app. Poor paid for version Love the free version. Bought the premium version only to find every time I have no internet connection,  it accuses me of not buying it and kicks me out.  Not happy.
Puzzles were not well thought out.
Very buggy...had to uninstall Causing massive problems with bluetooth syncing Note4VW. Song title does not update on the car, the sound cuts in and out nearly every 60 seconds, etc. Uninstalled and the problem went away.
Great Was a great  program. But after updating to lollipop it crashes everytime I open it.
Crap don't download it sucks
Pathetic coders Not working. Crashes every time I try to open. Uninstalling straight away.
Meh Meh  meh meeeeeh. Advertisement in paid version, Not accepted, The add virus injector ruined the app,  Remove the adds for a five

This game sucks I can't even get passed the first level

Well This game has some pretty bad graphics AND alot of glitches i turned right and my character kept running nowhere but i love the game plot and setting prob my crazy phone is just actingu guys should see in to the weak spots
Ripped off I WANT MY MONEY BACK THIEVING BASTARDS
It's OK Literally, the only difference between the lite version and this version is the ability to save. Add animals, monsters, and multilayer to make this worth our money.
My sister loves this app but it only has one instrument unlocked please unlock all the instruments and I will rate it five stars. And put any lock button so that my sister presses any button it doesn't exit except the home button.  THANK YOU.
Way too many ads There is a 30 second video ad between every 5 second puzzle.  Keep the ads video free and then I'd enjoy the game again.  Wack.
Buy My daughter thought it would be a good game but it turns out you need to buy the full version to do the whole game
Je t'aime en Dieu Mon Dieu
Bad game I hate it,  its uncontrolable. Very horrible.
This have potential But come on is so tiny the map I know is under development,  it's boring,  will uninstall and wait a couple months.
Its ok I dont like it to many ads and the game needs to give us atleast 500 coins in the beginning
Too many stupid questions Like how many apples in the tree Then you must first shake the phone and let more apples appear..
Make a new categorie for mitshubishi pajero sport. Make a search history possible and saved searches
Worst app Everytime I click draft activities during mock draft...the app crashes and I lose out on the draft and have to restart....worked fine before new update...get your stuff together already
Bad It said i was gonna get a baby on 2019 and im only 8
My mobile clonked I bought the game.  Installed it.  And it shows a blank screen. Why
Too many ads There's a video ad after every level, and a banner ad while each level is loading. Frustrating.
Disappointed Game is functioning very bad. Full of bugs too.
Horrible when you go to the audio thing it won't let you play on any on photos or video player
Horrible Can't craft anything
No new levels Love the game but I have been waiting for new levels in cranky and allie for almost a year. Nothing yet.
Needs fixing asap Sony Xperia z1 does not work crashes every time u even attempt to buy a property please sort it out. Thanks very  much
Pay to win even with the pro version, it seems a bit greedy and money hungry. Levels scale up quickly and are not week thought out. A rip off of better games.
Child games...
If you don't stop the game during the spins you will never get the bonus Odds are worse than the casinos
Dungeon cooldown And many Bug After update so many bug in this game, Ex cant party trials, city defend and battlespire. I love this game. Please fix it
One of the most simple level design I ever played not worth a penny, and doubtful even if it was free
Crashing It crashes everytime you check draft activity in Mock Drafts
Thief This app took my money and did not install the plugin I'm highly mad right now

Need a refresh Nice content but needs a full ui refresh.  Looks outdated
Not worth it.. Poor collection but nice effort to provide something.
Ads ads ads Keeps trying to get me to download other games.. wouldnt be so bad but they pop up right when I winlose a game and I accidentally end up in Google play when I don't  want to be.
Exits immediately One bug is messing on mine, it always  puts me back at the home screen. Pls fix it I will rate 5 stars.
O jogo  direto interrompido com propagandas

Nice game but The game is not working on MOTO G 2nd generation and while playing for minute game crashes.Please do someting

Love the game, hate the bugs Soo many corrupt games all the time.. super disappointing to have a game break all the time. When a game works, the games play is awesome, and the game modes are a lot of fun.
Would b good but... Can't get into my old account... Don't know if it's cuz I hav 2 wait forever... But it just won't load
Was good before The app used to be good but of recent it always gives errors apologising that due tech problems it can not connect, please try again later. Same BS all the time. Really disappointed

Game doesn't work This game does not work on galaxy S5  no letters can be selected to guess so utterly pointless game I want a refund
Stupid app Useless app, cannot view live tv. Nonsense Dont waste ur time
Not working at all now How is it you update apps and always mess them up
I hate it This game is so stupid and silly.
Weather doesn't refresh Nice watch face, however the weather doesn't refresh unless you open app on your phone Very disappointed.
gin rummy love the game but way to one sided and the pop ups are draining my battery very frustrating
Bought the game, can't play, keeps crashing. Please fix this issue and I'll change the rating.
Cant play Really a great game But cant play it since in note 4
 ,   ,    ,     ,      ,    ,  ...    .
 WONT LET ME PLAY HATE U WHO EVER MADE THIS N IF I DONT GET MY MONEY BCK I AM GETTING MY DAD LAWYER SUE U
 
Update is a rip off. Newest update causes performance issues and pretty much requires you to buy coins to unlock the extras. I already paid.for the game so this is a slap in the face. Don't even play this game now because of the price gouging.
It sucks I can't  play at all and I don't  get my money back Don't  get it if you know what's good for  you .
Sucks Downloaded it. It opens, the timer runs but the fruit doesn't move It says the bugs are fixed but it doesn't work on my phone Definitely uninstalling it Looking forward to playing anew game but this one won't work
Trouble after last update After last update, I can't get start a game or even get into the main menu. It only stuck at the loading page which shows us the word RUZZLE. Please fix this. It should be a good and fun game.
I don't know the password.
Lack of competition. I also own a iphone and there are two competitors.  Thus, both of them are by far better than this not really flexable program. I payd for it because I thought it has to be better.
Crashes Yes and it doesn't bother to cross the splash screen anyway.
Is it a joke While other services and apps become better and better with the time, yours both service and app is just worse. Congratulations. You're mastering reverse development Shame.
To much adds Uninstalled in less than 15 min had over 4 sets of ads. Total waste
Team cricbuzz, please work on 'no network' problem, kindly resolve this problem. I'm not able to see updates and scores.
Not a big game Game for children
Content is great, the app is not. I find the way to view topics and consume  information cumbersome and off putting.
Keeps closing Hopefully they will fix it.
Annoying bug Decent game, but if you switch to check messages or if you receive any phonecalls then you lose all save progress because the game goes irreversibly blank when you switch back.
Atrocious Graphics, dull gameplay and microtransactions
That game sucks more than anything It wouldn't let me refund or play it froze for me I would not donload it if I was u
DO NOT BUY, BETTER FREE OPTIONS OUT THERE Gave it another chance after the Dev finally updated the app after months of no update. Still sucks, no  notification settings. No swipe scrolling. Half assed app.
Mini piano failed The only song that sounds right is Just Give Me a Reason.... I mean baby by Justin sounds like Amazing Grace
Doesn't Work The print and download option doesn't work for coloring pages.  Samsung Galaxy Note 4
Suck Need an internet connection
Harmonium Apps not working When I run this app, max times with in 2 sec, message appears Harmonium free app stopped. Its hangs when 23 stings pressed and I have to force close this apps. Kindly do changes, so that this app can work properly.
Sucks
Wow pop up city The slowest and worst out there
Free for ios but android must pay
Inappropriate description This app may be good, but it's description makes users think wrong about it. It's a skin for a widget, not a standalone app, but it is not reflected in the summary.
Good while it worked Error code 8 app unlicensed.  Played two games wtf....
This app barely even works on my phone. It takes to long to load everything and one wrong click and the app will freeze up and shut me out. It didn't used to be this bad so I'm not sure why the updates made it worse.
Shitty game Full of advertisements, force u to loose so that u will use real money, damm unfair. In 10 arena matches, enemy begins first in 8. Hahaha great coin flip.
Not worth the effort When keyboard is open on lock screen the return key does not work so you cannot enter the pin. Device locked itself after an update without an account being created. Hassles for no reason
Shield Tablet  Render is all over the place The players don't move their arms are disconnected from their body. The game is unplayable in this condition. Real shame. Please can you look into it
Garbage No fun at all. Developer should delete this trash and start over.
Money grab 12 minutes in. I have reached the free game limits real money is needed  to continue. 3 2 1 uninstall
Boring You all ways do the exact samething over and over again. I wish I could refund it but I cant.not worth it
Doesn't work It keeps freezing. My daughter couldn't even use it once. I would like a refund.
Updates please I like this game but it needs more things to do like expand the village and have a family EA needs to fix this and make updates like they do for the Sims free play Needs more updates
Can't install it...its worst game I hv ever seen..Full of bugs p
Its the best music player but I dont know why the speed of song is very slow and not normal. It seems like slow motion I dont know where to report this to make the song back to the normal speed. Give me an idea if you know it Thanks
Latest update I do not like the latest update as it makes it harder to use the score board. Until the update everything was just fine. The undo button does not stay up long enough
Ruim de utilizar, incompatvel com celulares mais modernos... Interface ruim, e s  compatvel com o celular mais velhinho da famlia. Lamentvel.
Copyrighted Terrible Don't waste your time
I like the game
New update sucks Even though this fancy popout option sounds great, how would I know when since the last update I cannot watch any stream. It's just black screen. Only Chat and Only Audio options work well, but video doesn't work at all.
Does not play Game will not let me push play button will not go past user choice screen
Bakwaas Are bhai purane to free me padhwa do
This app is a joke... This app is a joke your website is fine gives out the right measurements but this app gives out incorrect measurements by a lot and yes... Its the same internet connection fix this

Bad Experience There is no any option for steering and nice graphics bt u have to fix tht prob
Force Closes Since last update,  this game shoves me out on loading screen. Never had a problem with this game....until now.
That's not how you play mancala jfc
Worthless Does not show trail maps. Topo maps are available for free on Google maps.  I was misled into believing this app would have trail maps.  App is useless.  Waste of 4.
Doesn't even start up properly Sort your app out dstv.
Game will not fully install. no response The game installs from the play store but then requires a 300Mb download, which stays at 0. Opened a trouble ticket with the vendor, including screenshots but no response. LG Gpad 8.3
Info No explanation of numbers or letters in colored circles, no explanation of alot of things on the different pages.
Same same What is the difference between teen Patti lucky card and teen Patti club lucky
Keeps force closing Application keeps force closing on me. Fix it and 5 stars are yours. Can't use it right now.
Hate it This isn't as fun as I thought it was I used to have a app like this and it was better then this jank
Doesn't play on Xperia. Just shows highscore tables and that's it. Uninstalled
Uninstalling this Can't get past the green screen. Emailed the suggested address, no response. Tweeted the account, was promised an update. No update. Going shaun hunting today, no point in having this app if it doesn't work.
Best
Very unhappyNo tilting. I loved playing this game and have several characters. Just lately I have been unable to tilt.  This has made the game useless to play.  Please provide fix.
Disappointed but hopeful My main concern is there seems to be an issue when attempting to trace the letters. Please fix or advise
Why is it doing this I just downloaded the app and i do one thing athena tells me to do and it sends me to the play store... EVERY TIME. fix it then we see
Does not launch.  I like this TV show.  Fix it now
Guys this game keeps kicking me back to home screen, my wife and 4 year old boy are GUTTED. please help
Loved game but recent update made app not open, contacted 2xl about problem and got no response. Shame as game worked great prior to update.
Why only one station It only gives you one station to play at or you have to purchase the rest of the other things i think that you should have to reach a certian point in the game with coins to unlock places
Iiiiiiii hate it This is a joke I can't even do search about the manga that I want
DO NOT BUY Bought this app to look at stars but it does not work, and to add to this developer has not answered any emails I sent for refund, so I'm stuck with this crappy non working app and 2.50 less.  DO NOT BUY
Good Concept But.. The game says it matches you against people with same skill, it's a total lie. Will Match you against opponents light years ahead of you. People only play one Class because it's so over powered so be prepared to only fight Priests.
Bekar hai Kuch kam ka nahi
Chess Everytime his man gets jumped they won't allow me quit it u Sally rabbot so u get a sad face
Crashes everytime I try to open it, no updates....screaming toddler. Waste of my money 
Just bought this but will ask for money back, game will not orient to landscape modeJust bought this, will get money back, game will not orient to landscape mode. Have loved all the other Dr. Pandas for my 3 year old grandson   
Changed my rating Just up and stopped working after the latest update. Had this app forever.  Nice work guys...gonna uninstall and drop u to one star. Im sure y'all could care less.

What happen to the search bar this ifunny isnt funny at all,and 4 pics at once too much, gotta delete this until yall bring back some of the old features
Keeps crashing Good game when you first start after 2nd fight it crashes every time sort it out then will give 5 stars
Remembered Why I Deleted this Game Didn't win much and only win a little even with max bet, opened 3 slots gets more expensive, going to go back to GSN
Opening problem Previously it was going good bt now i have a problem opening it.. It doesn't opens up.. It only opens for the first time u install. After it it's such a mess 5 stars if gets sorted out
Stopped working Used to work great. I think it stopped working after lollipop upgrade. Now it just crashes before finishing loading.
        
Ugly game ever If I turn it he's so slow,
Does not work
WHAT THE HELL I NOW CANT CHANGE MY PROFILE PICTURE BECAUSE OF ALL THE STUPID UPDATES... Thanks
Crashes to home screen after 60 seconds. It looks like it might be a good shooter, but I don't get the opportunity to play it for long enough. I hope a patch is coming to fix the issue.
Fix crashes. It's been less than a minute and.. Well, fix it.
Best Twitter app BUT.... somehow my activity section doesn't work and i hate it. I'll give it 5 stars when my problem will resolve.
O
Maybe I am not sure  that  is  going to  workand now i hate it
Great game ruined by intrusive reminders The game itself is excellent. What knocks a full three stars off my rating is the makers' decision to bombard me with notifications, instructing me to play it.
No hints I love this game but I'm stuck on lvl 3 and the game provides no hints.  Very frustrated.
Haven't used it yet because my countriesNamibia location is not available. Had to select a location from my neighbouring country just to get in and see what people are selling I can't sell anything
this game is a rip off it won't let you refund Google needs to fix this immediately
You cant use more than onr finger at a time
Import from free version doesn't work... I want to be able to transfer the elements I created in the free version, but it doesn't work. Please fix
Crap Doesn't load.. show failure,  errors. . Crap  crap crap crap crap crap
Ridiculous This was supposed to be a free app. Then I get charged for it. And now can't get a refund because the fifteen minute window is closed. Shame on this app. I'd be saying a lot worse but I'm holding my tongue
ADS The ads are super annoying Every ten mins an ad pops up I'm uninstalling this 
Just bought the full version. And it won't download it  keeps giving  an error message. Once I  can get it to download and install. I'll give a better review
, The tags dont get me likes i spend my money on nothing worth it
I liked this game alot But it's incompatible with Nexus 5  10 If it's not compatible with some of the best devices on the market you're really losing grip of things. I PAID for this app too. Fix this and I'll write a great review for you.
Nice Once I logout, ,, and I tried several times to login, but I could not.
Billed me twice I bought this app, but they billed me twice
Laaaaaagggggg I dont know what happened to this game. It is lagging all the way on my Galaxy Note 4SMN910c since the last update. All other games are buttery smooth except this one
Hmmm Looks like a good app, but how to change language It said it's available in 4 languages. Couldn't find that option
Cool Ya it's good...
Doesn't work on 5.1.1 Bacon
Wouldn't open This morning I tried to play it but it kept freezing on the loading screen. 5 stars if fixed.
Rubbish Fare calculator not even remotely accurate. Will uninstall immediately. Waste if data
Not good You cannot set up your pieces the way you see fit. Where is the strategy in that
Opened it up and it crashes . Refund or fix
I HATE this game When I was on lvl 5 Cuz I just started. I shut down my phone. Then, I got back to it and BAM I went back to lvl 1. Please fix this and I will give this game 5 stars
It's ok but still shit
Worst It only had three animals to play with.
Rubbish Not even English
Sucks This app sucks because when I try to listen to my recordings all it does is sound like static
You  guys  are  so  greedy This  is  a  little kids game  and  you're  making  them  play  only  one  feature
None of the reallt famous compositions here. Boring. I did not know Mozart made so many boring compositions.
I hate it it doesnt let me get joy power up
HD graphics won't upgrade I can't upgrade my graphics to the HD version, I just keep getting an error.
Very upset after paying to download app did not work.  Also would not give option to refund my money.  Terrible app and terrible way of conducting business.  Thiefs
Does not work Updated to lollipop and it says I am not connect to the internet ever since. Received an update on the app since but no change.
Can see pics in gallery even after locked I have locked pics and saved in photo vault but still able to see them in gallery. It is just same app locker like other apps, photo vault and video vault is not working 
Fix it It always stops in the middle of a call and my friends can't call me back .
Gave Up You guys suck Petition for a refund. Crooks This is how you roll You charge for an app and never update. This should be considered a ripoff. Even free apps update more than this and if they stop at least it was free.
Ugh It keep taking its precious time to load I tried yesterday and today it didn't even let me play
 The comments ppl say were great and I wanted to try the game but when I get in the app, a ad pops up then it crashes. Please fix this.
I was up to level 6 and then logged in later and it was back to level 2  This game has serious problems.
Horrible It keeps crashing, and you can't buy vowels HATE IT
very bad application because jab meri chance aata hi aur mai marna chata hu to bich me app kaam nahi karta hi
Not worth money Bought the game...beat it in 3 days.  It's fun but doesn't last long.  Buildings only upgrade once or twice and free play is pointless once you beat it.
Does not work On my G6 at all
Refund Refund button works
Incredibly slow This app is ridiculously slow. My nephew can't even enjoy it.
Could not be downloaded I constantly got a error 905 telling me it couldn't be downloaded due to an unknown error. I either want a fix, or my money back asap.
Dont like much It takes too much space
Telltale does it again But can't install epidsode 3. So far amazing script and graphics. Real smooth on my HTC one m8. Complaint the 3rd epidsode will not download on my galaxy s6.
Cant sign in Made a account cant sign in cant create another account and i paid for this app and i cant do anything with it
Buggy It looks like it would be a half decent game if the controls were sorted out. Don't bother with this if you only have a touch screen. I can't seem to move up or right, only down and left, and there's nothing wrong with my screen.
Can't complete beginning I can't even get much into the tutorial because a monster isn't spawning after I select the sword, also switching between buttons can be sticky, would love to download if these problems are addressed
Useless It has been 1 month since OneLouder broke Tweetcaster for the Samsung Galaxy S4. I waited patiently for the app I paid for to resume widget functionality and nothing has been done. Very disappointed.
Strzt immer wieder ab.
TOO MANY ADS Plus this game eats all my CPU power on my phone. The ads pop up at critical times and it drives me nuts.
Can't play it It'll go to a screen with the play button and I'll press it. Nothing has happened for 1 hour and during the time I sit pressing the button repeatedly. Please fix for 5 stars
Rip off So at first I paid for extra features and then they made these free. I then stupidly paid again for the uprated version. Now the want more money again. No excuses, simply greed. Uninstalling.
You can't even style them up.
0 truthfully.  Backs me out every time I get to a new level.
LIVE HOLDEM POKER PRO Oh I see I'm the only 1 who can't play this game. Wow
Cant play When I try to use the interact button on something it doesnt work, if it worked I would of loved the game
Was a good app Put the uniform regs back on No one cares about the pictures. Calculators always crash...
Keeps Stopping Fun to play but it keeps stopping and get a message that says unfortunately solitaire has stopped.
Constantly disconnecting When I first purchased this device it worked great. Now it's just about useless because it won't stay connected. I'll be purchasing an alternative soon so I can ditch this piece of garbage.
Refund It kept laying out I would like my money back there's better things to buy
Waste of time It doesn't work. And it's not the fault of ELM327 which I successed to connect with another Torque app
Can't Login The app won't let me log in. I have changed my password, typed it out several times and nothing has changed I keep getting the same message Unable to login. Please try again. This would be SO helpful if I could actually log in
Doesnt open Payed the money and the app does not open on my phone
Nope Highly inaccurate.  20 degrees off.
Not so good app Dear team, whenever I try to move pictures or videos out of vault, it says I do not have enough SD card space to move them but in reality I do have more than enough SD card space..can u tell me how to fix this
It's the wost
Shuffle You would do well to learn the word shuffle.
Bug Use to work but developed a bug somewhere along the way. Can't select teams only the margin.
Auto important does not work. Can I have a refund Pointless having manually import the data.
City Bike Race Stunt 3D Bike race sucks

No not get this app The checks are terrible and the joystick has difficulty sensing your finger. Also the goalies don't make any saves.
To many adds
To many ads I downloaded this today and played for only a little while and after about 47 hands an ad would pop up right when I was touching to start a new round forcing me to leave the game and go to the ad website.
Belom coba Kalau bagus tak kasih bintang 5 ...tapi kalau jelek hapus
Forced tilt controls invasive ads Touch controls are better than overly sensitive tilt controls.  And the ads don't let me get past the first 5 seconds of gameplay before the game reloads itself and I have to start over.  Please sort this out.
Really good but..... It stucks still I will rate it 4 because of it's 3d effects
pay to win if you want to change your party each new member costs more than the game...
No way to restore it to aviary editor. Want a refund the restore thing is not working
Hated it I hated it cause its so boring. Every time or day I go into this game I feel so bored.
Desperately needs to be recoded from the ground up, was probably ported straight over from the iOS version, resulting in the clunky and slow UI that looks stuck in Android 2.0 days.
Wtf This may be the worst money I have ever spent. You cant hit people, graphics suck, no fights. 2k is only good with basketball and I think ea might be taking that over too. EA is ten times better.
Doesn't work White screen when trying to choose between George and Peppa. Uninstalled to reinstall it and it's the same thing.
Wow Seal your love in a lip lock but  don't let the world catch in action

Great game but... Keeps crashing after a few minutes of playing. Please fix this  Phone HTC One M8
Unrealistic levels There is no levels at all. It's unrealistic to feel nice, when all the hurdles comes in the first pace itself.

Bluetooth This app automatically switches on my Bluetooth and makes it visible to all. This puts my phone at risk and also drains my battery. Remove this discovery or I will take off vitality drive from my policy.

Elijah Crap
Did not work This app never even opened on my Samsung. Tons of bad reviews, don't waste your time. How hard is it to develop a robust app in 2015 WSL failed.
Widget is junk, app is fine If I use the widget to turn it on and off, it will crash repeatedly and start itself back up over and over again. If I go through the app, there's no problem. Please fix the widget.
Inaccurate I purchased the full version and yet my daughter cannot play the learning activities. We are only able to play the free version even after purchasing the full version and I need a full refund if it's not fixed within the next hour or less.
It's not free You have to pay to get pass the info
Waste Waste waste waste
Frustrating I am unable to get any of the characters to be able to use their inventory.  I open it up, and the items are there, but tapping on them does nothing. Can't win the game if you can't use the items.  So ... worthless.
Dum
Extremely limited options and inconsistent AI Stunned there is no option for 'hitting on the first trick'.  Hearts games issued years ago had this simple feature.  Also, the AI is inconsistent at the 5 star ratings.
Summer levels are too hard I paid for nothing can not play the game anymore Too hard to play not fun anymore
Awful Ads are too much
Its fine but i cant turn off notifications Need an option to shut it up.

Rubbish Wouldn't let me pick letters and kept crashing  Uninstalled
How the hell do you get 4,4 stars stupid game with poor graphics and control hole game makes no sense at all
Yawn. Too difficult to get expansions. Extremely slow going game and they try too hard to force you to buy diamonds. Items cost an excessively high amount of diamonds to build, it's ridiculous

What a load of Rubbish trash PEGI 3 is producing a lot of pointless games, putting me off android... Don't waste your time. Obviously designed by a retarded Muppet, I give up on android, used to be good. Bloody crap now
This does not worth a dollar..maybe 25cent..
Inaccurate This app totally inaccurate. It punishes for harsh breaking and cornering even on freeways when going well within the speed limit. Had me driving down a railway line on one occasion. It's actually a joke.
It so bad I cannot  this I say do not download it
This app is crapp does not work at all

Oh, is it 1989 yet Seriously....
Waste of time Wrong schedules
             
Terrible App This app hardly ever runs. It practically does nothing but freeze and irritates my kids and I. We are highly dissatisfied and I am considering canceling my membership. Using this program on the computer is hardly any better.
Fakes Too make fake profiles
No Seems to use data from domestic weather stations most not set up correctly. Not a forcasting app relies on data that is unreliable.

I like the game but now I'm getting adds with video. Video uses data and costs me money. So in reality, the game isn't free is it. I think it's time to delete this game. And I've had it on my phones for a long time.
Lost everything Played this game for ages and loved it. Bought the best car you can in the game and had it maxed out to log on the next day to find I no longer have any of my old cars and back to nothing

Creation lab Don't we already wait long enough Why make us wait any long when the want to evolve a dinosaur and it fails
Lost everything  support sucks I lost everything, lack of transfer  cloud prevents you from restoring, customer support is horrible and have not refunded money spent.
Wtf Why do I have to use extra data to download another app for the weather to use the bloody clock,  unistalled,  time wasted.
Could be so much better Can not stand the fact your not able to cancel or delete your account.. Horrible support staff on the site...
Super fun but... Did you know that they can use your mic and hear you Creepy.  Though fun, its not worth your safety. Without that fact, I would give this two 5 star ratings.
Very buggy The load screen pops up with the home screen and the gun won't fire and the gun disappears
Boring
App not functioning I tried to reinstall but it still dosen't work. It says it has to download resourse files yet it cannot contact the server. Very disappointing.
Not really for sports fans Just got a breaking news alert that. Catlyn Jenner won an easy for bravery. Maybe I'll come back to this app when they become more About sports and less about PC crap.

Download failed game cannot run Paid and installed the game but the additional data 300mb download kept failing I was on wifi. In fact the download never pass 0.  Now I can't even get a refund.
Limited Options No option to play game without allowing developer to collect data from your phone.
Not so Pro anymore It's been two years and nothing has been done to update,  upgrade or improve upon this app. Most disappointing, shows a lack of motivation, with a great deal of laziness from the developer. There is no reason or excuse for this.
Crashes I can't even start the app... It used to work really well. Not it won't work at all I missed Danisnotonfires live show 
Error 101 Please fix the error 101 issue with screen resize as you promised on support forum that u are working on a fix... It still do not work

Boring app All you can do is race and build tracks. There should be more to the app since it's 6.99, especially more educational games. My son keeps seeing the commercials for new tracks and there are no updates for the app
Too easy
Hate it with a passion Ad's pop up so much the game won't start. At least I didn't wast a penny on it.

Total ripoff Trying to do a PRACTICE game, had to download the full version just to realize the game is stupid. Waste of money

Game Crashes Frequently I love the Civilization franchise, and this game has great potential, but it crashes only after a few minutes of play. It would a good game if it didn't crash so frequently.
Keeps crashing freezing I just bought this less than an hour ago, because I love this game. Unfortunately, it kept making my phone crashfreeze up. So, I just uninstalled. I'll reinstall again to see if there are any positive changes to game play.
I already found 9 relics and it only takes 7 to unlock the desert.. Guess what, i can't unlock it. Very disappointing given the fact that after a while you get bored of the same tracks. Other than that, it works well and the graphic is great.
Doesnt work Not working in Australia
Spoilt The update has completely  spoilt the game, I do not like the new look. Daily  challenge  ruined  with targets. Used to enjoy them but  have yet to reach targets set.  SPOILT by update  If it aint broke  why fix it

Breaks recordings up into multiple cslls If you have a two hour phone call, you end up with 40 individual calls recorded at anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes each.  Frustrsting.  Also, does not record with bluetooth.

Battery drainer If you want an app that sucks back battery life like a housewife at a wine festival, then this widget is for you.  In the meantime, this widget gets one star for being a battery draining power hog.

Want to love it The input is ridiculously laggy. I can't even get past the league setup because each key input takes 5 key presses. It's just unusable at this point.
Not bad. The steering controls are not good. .its quite hard to take a left turn please fix..not worth the price waste of money...
Game is rigged The higher you go in career your defence becomes less responsive. Think the idea is to make us shell out more money in upgrades. Not ethical.
Rubbish My little girl was so disappointed when this jammed up trying to load,  so we deleted it and downloaded it again only to get the same thing. Would not recommend this to anyone until it is fixed
Keeps crashing Since downloading this game I've made it 3 levels and it continues to crash. Otherwise, it seems like a cute game.
It sucks Don't download this game Too many glitches and adds
Corrupted update Eith this update I can only clear errors and get information on how to pay. No self service capability. Guess you want us to call the call centre instead

Sugarsmash 'The Book of Life' While playing, the game just QUITS  Please fix I'd probably rate a 5, except for that problem.
Doesn't really help much, and update makes it run all the time from boot.  Might as well use maps.
Won't load I bought the game for my kids kindle and it loaded fine. Well it was so much fun I tried downloading onto my phone and it won't load
No point to this game.
The controls are aweful and unresponsive.   You have a good concept for a game, if you fix the controls it could be very fun.
Get this game banned Such a bad game hangs all the time once it hanged whren i was playing high table mathch and i was having AAA CARDS and this hell game hanged that time and i lost over 1m money wtf is this i want my money back .huhh fix this shit
Too many ads every time I try to do anything, and I did 2 things to get free pearls I followed the exact instructions and I have yet to receive my pearls.
What's deluxe about it I purchased Hotel Dash, loved it, so I decided to get Hotel Dash Deluxe. Apparently, Hotel Dash has a twin and Deluxe is what they call him Really It's identical to the 1st one.
Too many adds Some games interesting but got fed up with the pop up adverts and the lack of options for each game. For example, would like to have a n unlimited time option. 60 seconds got boring.
Stoped working after update, please fix
Won't start Just keep getting some random error marmalade something or other and it hangs on the EA logo Nexus 6 running 5.1
Not able to log on Since the update I haven't been able to log on. Previously it worked.
Force closing every time. The app force closes every single time I try to open and use it. I had this app before and it never did this.
The new update They literally went commercial and it's bad pictures got smaller so they could advertise. Mention the ads in the update description next time guys.
Well it is loading so much.....I hate it................
Can't restore data I have used the app through at least three phone changes. No matter what, I can NEVER RESTORE MY DATA It makes me so angry to have detailed notes and lose them all I backed it up through email and my device and neither worked. Why
Detailing needed App developer seems in hurry to make cash. Ads are annoying
Buruk Terlalu banyak iklan .... Tolong benerin komik Demon King .... Bacaannya selalu Can not connect to the server ....  BALAS Mohon Pencerahannya
Author do not respond to user suggestions at all Although it has been more than 4 years and after many emails between me and the author where I suggested him to make improvements for the game, he promised he will do it  but till now he did nothing
Game does not load Game is one of the most buggy I've ever played constant force closing. Now doesn't load at all. Also very hard to progress as everything costs stupid amounts of clams.
LIER Why did you make it only the Santa and bacteria I was really exited when I saw the zombie virus but we have to buy it Please change it or its just technically a demo if you do 5 stars
Popups cover the board.  I know its free but cmon.

Not reliable On my Galaxy Tab the physics often don't do what they are supposed to which means I can't finish some levels even with a walkthrough. Quite frustrating.
It doesn't open anymore If i can give it no stars i would. It was a great game then it updated now it doesn't open at all anymore.. Please fix and I'll change the star rating
Make it free
Useless Can't sync because the version on my ipad is different newer one . Can't use this one anymore so there is no cross sync. There is no cross sync so there is no use for the app. It just sits there empty on my phone. Looks great, does nothing.
Unreliable Used to be reliable...  Now isn't working with my ezcast as well as it used to.... Freezing lots and not finding DLNA easy at all. Not impressed
Stop telling me you don't support the Box I gave you good money for  
Come on lego Fixed main graphic glitches but responsive as a FIFA chief. Come on Lego lets jump when asked not sometime after the event. Currently somewhat frustrating.

Sorry to say , do not download this app Very bad app..i just opened my app and it just booked a cab to airport. I dont know how...
Money sucking scam If I wanted to loose real money I'd go to a real casino. I've learned that all they want is YOUR money Payouts are small and bonuses are seldom. I've had enough, I'll be deleting app as soon as I hit submit.
bugs love the game but the new update brought some irritating bugs in the game plz fix then I will rate 5 stars.
Just downloaded Will give more stars as I begin to use the app hopefully I won't have to uninstall well I'll be seeing you all soon for another rate
A disappointment It was terrible I read the reviews. They are not true
Doesn't stay connected After a bit, the controls disappear from my taskbar. Which means I have to reopen Netflix and wait and so on.. Not sure which of you is the problem, so I'm rating you both a 1.
Free grabs through game download If I'm going to download a game for more grabs, then I'd best be getting them. WTF. This happens too often
Lost all cards I paid for. Like title says. Come update time all my paid cards were gone. Granted I didn't spend no more then like 11 or 12 on cards but still to have them disappear is kinda upsetting so I'm lowering my rating to a 2 for that reason.
Took for ever It took for ever to install
Dumb Dumb game
Keypad won't come again and randomly disappears. Have to quit each time  and log back in. After hitting send, it rarely comes up
Ok The app is ok. I don't really like how sometime you refresh it takes awhile to show where a person is at. It can as long as an hour or so just for the refresh to work.
Cake maker Is nice and delicious
App is horrible. Cant change the settings, can't bid your own books...they bid for you based off how many spades are in your hand.... only good thing is u can invite friends
Does not connect with my controller I bought a Moga Hero Power, and this game will not read it.
Why bother Too too many ads. Every time you click one thing an ad pops up. Makes the game so unenjoyable.
Promise not kept As I did not get 10 gold each for completing level 1 and 2 and also did not get 60 gold in gunship battle for the same as per the scheme
Totally making fool I download this app through m cent but I didn't get any airtime and not showing in processing list just fake don't download this please use Google play for apps.
Three strikes and your out 717 Another update, another fail. Still no streaming video. If I could give negative stars I would.       716 Still, even after the update, none of the streaming works. A total failure so far....
This app is ridiculous 2 and worked 5 minutes can I have my money back please, or information on how to make it work my 2 year old nephew is really upset at the fact its not working.
It's ok but .. I don't feel it offers very much at all. For some extremely basic options it's alright but it needs FAR more widget alternatives like a 3x1 horizontal  vertical for example. It really is very basic, for my needs that is.
It Lags I couldn't play the game because it lagged even after I'd boosted the ram. It also didn't show things, like my collections.
not good for me location is often incorrect.  not a must have for me, but since it mostly give the wrong location, I don't need it.  thanks
You can't save your creations so when my device runs out of charge or I turn it off, I have to start over and rebuild everything

Gay I think it is b that    you have to pay for the second that
Holy crap they didn't do well Right now, the game has just frozen. This is the 9th time in the. 3 days I've played this. The game itself is good in terms of game mechanics and plot but good god do they need to fix bugs.
Bad... In recording When Calling by us...no voice hear from another person....we receive call..it's ok and clear

Just never download it.............. It is not a game but just a prank
Do not get this game 1 The clock in this game is broken. It does not stop after incomplete passes, going out of bounds or after touchdowns which is very upsetting if you are trying to make a comeback.
Simply doesn't work I've tried numerous locations and have registered but the Request Taxi stays greyed out. I've even tried pretending I'm in the US but it still didn't work. Uninstalled.
So hard Everything makes me lose my ring s till i die IT IS SO HARD. and it wont unlock tails or knuckles
Ok It was kinda fun but you have to buy eveything so whats the point of playing
Good game The is good still but only paid users can own in this game while the free users suckz in the game.... Everything good graphics, avathar challenge monsters skills but sadly the devs want cash... Real Money deals more in this game...

Bad customer service There are no instructions and I can't figure out how to play. No answer to my emails to maker.

Below Par My least favorite major golf app of the bunch. App is filled with a lot of filler that I personally don't want or need. Updates are slow and almost annoying. Don't really care about fans having a pint, I just want the essentials.
Flashing Ads Can't see cards with the flashing ads.
Restore Property Income Lowering income from property to force users to watch ads when low on funds is just low. I paid for this game. Restore the property income to previous values please.
liked app I must uninstall due to the opiate commercials below My grandaughter is 3.
Boring game There are only 4 drums and drum set has 6 drums
Unbelievable I had 3 of a kind and they split my pot wit some other dude talkin about 2 pair. Wtf

Time doesn't update in ambientdimmed mode Kind of pointless if your watch doesn't display the current time. Also, please consider an option to remove the hour marks on the outside. These are a big waste of space on a square watch.

Waste of money Used to work and daughter loved it, now it has stopped working and she is sad

THE DRIFTING This is making me break my neck. The only way to watch anything is with a locked screen no 360 rotation after its locked and a tilt to unlock. Please fix this fast. And my rate will go to 5.
Hb3d Not working on my new Samsung s5. Game is too slow and freezing up. Send updates soon. Then 5 stars, now only 2.
Offline reading not possible, so it's useless for subway commutes. Authentication server frequently goes down can't log in making app useless for hours at a time for no real reason
For Yu Yureka Stopped working in CM12 Lolipop 5.0.2, everytime I start game it says unfortunately ifighter has stopped working.
Amateurish Poorly written questions. Sort of like trivia crack in that way. Slightly addictive though. I'll be uninstalling it after playing it for another ten minutes.

Really Erases my Data every time I get off. One word, Uninstall
Application keeps crashing Every time i want to log on need to enter my login and pass every time...this is a royal pain, also the fact that there no way to save the info like the web site can. Ever since this update the site has gotten worst.

I hate this game is so boring and Stressing it is lock

Better apps need I like it so much what, but the hole alphabet is not there.  And it stop at  letter H if  it actually go from AZ.
Biblically not accurate. Very disappointing app.  Plenty of ads that make navigation to the limited content difficult,  but worse that info lacks on what Bible actually says.

Ok
The makeup keeps disappearing. If the makeup would stay on I would have given it 5 stars.
Be careful this app tends to change your bets without warning and take your winnings, happened to me twice. Had 4.5 mil one minute and now zero do not waste your money it sucks
Poor game The graphics represents the Queen with a cross on its head instead of t king and worst of all, the computer said check when my king wasn't under threat.  I ended the game immediately and in installed the app.
Takes too long to load At the first time I was getting excited....but when I start the game it takes super super long that it needs to load 166....plz make it more shorter to load the game....
Last update Ever since the last update whenever I go to the angel section to try to upgrade their stats, I immediately get kicked out of the game. Please fix I wouldn't want to uninstall the game, I like playing it alot.

Doesnt work Doesnt even work on my samsung galaxy s3. The elements in the book dont show up
DO NOT BUY. This is a nice, simple app but, unfortunately, developer has abandoned it. He no longer updates, provides support  will not reply to paid customers. But he will take your money.
Ga pernah update Not bad sih.. Tp ga pernah di update ini aplikasi.. Sayang banget
Nope Apparently, Insomnia and seizures don't slow down the cure, EVEN THOUGH IT'S MENTIONED IN THE DESCRIPTION THAT IT SLOWS DOWN PRODUCTIVITY. UNINSTALLED
Can't count Often the actual number of beads in a cup turns out to be different from the number displayed. Also touch sensitivity issues. Sometimes ignores input only to act on it inappropriately later

Poop
Wak..... Worst game I have ever played
There is a major issue in Samsung S6 Edge with this app as none of the reports open up. Just a blank page with no change are numerous tries. Please try to fix this bug.  Thank you

Ads There was at least two ads when I died, and when you went to touch the little X you hit another stupid ad
Rip off Purchased top up money thrice. Credit card charged but top up money not received. Also backup data deleted. That's cheating.
There is a bug in the game, i bombed a letter it got rid of the F and when i tapped an A it turned into the bombed F no matter where it was placed.
Wish I had read the reviews, first. This game apparently has problems with the Sprint Galaxy Note 4. Hoping for a fix, soon.
Waste of time There is way too much ads and the reverse and drive switch is hard to switch
Stuck on enter ur name Game not working its stuck on enter ur name even after inserting 11 letters of my name it says enter aleast 3 characters u should fix it
Crap I used to love this app. Itbworkes perfectly. Now whenever I notice someone unfollows me i can't look who it is because all it says is error. Please fix and ill give 5 stars
Excellent game, however... ... it keeps crashing I get a black screen whenever it trys to load various games. When it works, it's a high quality app, addictive. I've tried reinstalling it but to no avail. Same problem. Shame.
Nice idea, gui is goofy I've given up on this app and wrote my own in Tasker. Maybe I'll try it out again sometime in the future to see if any of the glaring bugs and missing function is fixed.
Tanggung bacanya Aplikasinya simple, enak buat baca. Tp sayang, koleksinya tanggung semua.
Not the best Can create better than this. The game is very very very slow
Chat But Not Add I wanna chat with people before I add them to my friend list. Or I wanna be able to remove them from my friend list. Not hide them from the list and not block them like I have to now.

Keeps quitting game It starts smoothly bt after start running it crashes  quits automatically.... I m using moto g....pls fix
Not so Perfect Complete and easy to use. The only thing is that it is not compatible with the main Runtastic app. So anything you save here is not synced with that. Unacceptable.
Fun, but short and in need of proofreading Like others have said, some movie titles are misspelled, making it nearly impossible to progress. Plus, when completing the last level, it kicks you back to the start screen. That could be done better.
NO ADDS Bullshit. I paid for this app and Now there are adds..
Inutilisable en Belgique Impossible de regarder quoi que ce soit en Belgique  de plus j'ai t accueilli par une page de pub.

Audio  Video Stuttering As with all the other Telltale games, since the update to lollipop the audio and video stutter to the point the game is unpleasant and unplayable.
I hate this app Do not waste your money on this piece of trash . It is fun , but the lip syncing is off , it's upside down , and it hardly ever works

Bakwass

Good Best
                 
App tester Is ok how to do mix music. Its not a big deal to download this app.
Too often give your opponent wins. Not realistic enough.
This game is hard enough without pointless lag Especially when you can't complete a simple dungeon because of lag. I've got good WiFi and ram and yet I keep getting glitches etc
Toto tree house This game is so cute
Its okay for an app, but now I can't layer images Used to be able to load more than one gallery image at a time and layer them, now I can't and thats the main reason I PAID FOR THIS APP. Please fix.

Cannot save or share on Note 3. Crap app. Avoid this one until it's been developed properly.
Disfunctional It won't let me pick up objects without at least 80 attempts.  Focuses on making the character move instead. Terrible control layout  refund
Could be better Hard to upgrade players and equipment not to mention that you have to pay to hit in different ballparks.
Love the progress.. But have been unable to like  photos on the Nexus 6. It just says unable to like media.
Terrible The schedules are all wrong.
Needs to be updated Does not work in 5.1.1
Finger print lock It no more appears on my phone,n i love it
This is a app that I see almost 56 times a day but recent update ditches the opportunity of switching between news. Each time I need to go back and forth to read a news.. Moreover there is no font size selection like other apps..
More Frustrating Than Fun Animation is choppy, character customization is terrible, Chromecast crashes, and spinning is constant Bankrupts.  SPINNING EVEN IS BAD... THAT'S THE GAME  Don't spend the money.
Game Sucks WHY can't I continue from where I left off The fact that I have to start over at level 1 EVERY TIME I want to play is ridiculous. Please fix this issue.
Okay Easy to fly, hard to land... more room for improvement. After 1 year of uninstall, i thought there might be improvement, still no improvement. No help on landing, still easy take off and bad worst landing
waste simply waste of time downloading it
UNABLE to give zero Mother of all worst application available in the world. PLUNDERED my money and not even worth a penny. I strongly recommend not to download it.
Fun initially, then cannot log in, very annoying Had fun going through the tutorial,but after creating an account and verifying my email the game will not restart only returns to the create an account screen. 1 star and deleted.

Excited to play but after I sent the first round, I can't get the second round to load. It says download show for however long I keep it open. Re installing in hopes it gets fixed.
Warning Do Not Update Update makes game awful.  I loved the game and gave it 5 stars but now would give it 0 if possible.   Used to have options for game determine if you want game harder or easier, etc. No longer worth it
Horrible horrible update A few days ago this would have been a 5 star review,  now I'm going to uninstall. Not worth my time now. Used to spend hours playing this,  now i can't stand 1 game in solo mode. Great work at ruining the app
I don't know  Please fix I can't get on it Every time I click the app it it makes my screen go black and doesn't go on the game WASTE OF MONEY

UI UI
I want my 99 back It doesn't work plain and simple.
Started out just like the real game. The more you play it the worse your score. Very rarely do you get a yahtze or a score above 300. The player needs to win every once in a while. I'm deleting it right now
Why this games did not work plz fix this
The worst 20 minuets I spent in my life This stinks I hate this game its to easy and its anoing their some kids saying yay why won't the shut up

Give me choice on ambient 1 star until the devs make ambient mode optional. Let me keep the cool looking watch face on as long as I want. Others do it. Facer and Watchmaker to name 2. I can live with shorter battery life.

Jackpot Party Casino You're a ripoff When you claim you have a hot slot playing all it does is take your money.
Not good Won't scan a thing.
Disappointing port Online only, poor support, gross bilinear filtering used to resize the screen, colors are washed out, and it breaks with every os update. Unfortunate treatment for a gaming classic.
This sucks I spent a lot of money buying puzzles. I had to uninstall and then reinstall due to the app freezing up. Now all of the puzzles I purchased are gone.   If this gets fixed I will gladly go back to loved it.
Pathetic Useless app..slow.... Always gives errors
Nice looks, can't like anything Won't let me like any photos, it just displays cannot like media which is annoying. Not worth buying the full version, the free one would have been fine.
Annoying If there have to be ads then fine but why must they constantly flash. Will definitely delete if this doesn't change.
Okay It would be better if it had buttons that you have to press to attack and a joystick to move
ohno the Princess is in trouble

Good game but lags. Please fix the lag You can't play this game like this. You need to be able to time your jumps. Its great on apple products. Don't charge if you can't get it right on here. Droid 2
Stupid game When I try to swipe left and right and jump up and go down I just die.....hate the game so much
Help Every time I try to play I can only play for 3 minutes at a time then it brings me back to the play store where I bought it
Charges after you buy Wtf
Deceiving I expected it to actually use the phone as a laser pointer as described in the picture, but instead it turns out to be a picture of a laser pointer that makes sounds and makes the device vibrate. Absolutely useless.
Biggest Disppointment Ever How is this game compatible with my Droid 1 and my Droid Razr Maxx but not with the Samsung Galaxy S4, which is newer, beefier, and running 4.4  All of my FF and DQ purchases work on the S4 but not this.  Please fix this.

Bs I purchased the original app.  Now it looks like they're giving this one away and charging you for things you purchased in the old app.  Don't spend your money, they'll just abandon updates and try to sell you something else.
The Ads The ads are a bit excessive and I can't go one level without an ad popping up and not letting me play the game. This causes me to have to exit out of the app and restart it all over again. I'd love the game completely if it wasn't for this.
Refund please I like to get a refund please because it keeps lagging every game that I had of yours lagged please give me a refund thanks.

Hanging, hanging and hanging My tab is hanging now actually my tab is already slow but after installing it my tab is hanging and not working. Please don't install it.
It is a little buggy. When you get down to only having 2 stacks of gems to draw from you cant end turn and only take 2 gems.  Plus no online multiplayer yet. It is not worth 7 right now.
POS Don't waste your time.  Last update took all my coins. There are several slot games much better than this.
bugs i purchased this app and it is not working properly the pictures are cut out and is only flicking on the screen. what can be done about this
Widget doesn't display anything Update...after uninstalling and reinstalling the pro app the widget finally showed up. But the widget still doesn't display any data. Fix the widget.
A little tutorial would help Or even a help function. And if there already is one, maybe make it accessible to the people whom don't know this app.
CAN'T do everything
Can't create account After update to latest version I can't continue working with this app. It all times take me create account page. 2 stars for latest update, previous version was working good. Please fix it.
STUPID IT THE MOST BORING GAME EVER IT'S TO HARD TO DRIVE  SAVE YOUR TIME DON'T DOWNLOAD THE GAME
No funciona Fecha sozinho quando abro as configuraes
Its useless and adverts pop up what like 2 seconds I actuatly like the ads better 
Categories gone I no longer have the recent New categories. The 80's, the 90's, Irish, Valentine's categories, etc.. they are all gone. Why'd you remove them Horrible
Old game, new advertising It doesn't matter how much they spend on big breasted spokeswomen, its still an old game with old graphics

SCAMMER FRAUD PRODUCT DON'T BUY IT PLEASE IF YOU LOVE YOUR MOTHER YOUR FATHER AND ENTIRE GENERATION DON'T BUY THE ITEM IT FAKE AND FRAUD......
Application doesn't work App only worked once and now it doesn't work anymore complete waste of time
Omg so bad Like no goal, and all you do is get people, and control the speed
Crashing The app crashes every few minutes in the background and I constantly get notifications that its crashed, it's rather annoying to have pop ups that an app has crashed and it's not even open but rather running in the background
Waste It's  the worse weather app ever. It dose nothing. It just shows up as a short cut to nothing.
Kept freezing. Could not play it 
Bingo crush Every time i try to go into mini game it kicks me out of game back to home screen. Before update it worked fine. I just want to delete game Am very upset. I used to like game even tho credits never increased

Love to play You don't get many tokens to play with. And there's no way to add more tokens unless buying them.
Short game.. Son completed game in 3 minutes. Not worth 2.99..
PLAYER Thinking thinking in multiplayer really sucks.... please do someth8ng for this paart.... Offline is gr8...
Very inconsistent with app profiles. The profiles kick in half the time and half the time they don't. Sometimes they don't even get the profile correct. It would be an awesome app but without this functionality it's pretty useless.
Too easy It was, so easy and stupid even a 3 year old though it was easy
News feed The earlier news feed was better as we could switch between news.. Now I have to come back everytime.. I hope that feature is brought back.. Thank you 
Won't work Every time I open the app, it just goes 2 home screen. Only once it did work but it was super  laging and I could not find wings.but it looks amazing so please fix and I will rate 5 stars. Thank you
HTC m9 Frames jitter really bad on Snapdragon 810 terrible. Worked for everything  else m7 Snapdragon 600 m8 Snapdragon 801.

Weird bug I was exiting out and it kept coming back on my screen, please fix it. I'll give it 5 stars if you do.
This app used to be great But now everytime i open it, it crashes or closes. It acts like it wants to load but then just crashes. I love this app please get it working again
Boring It was just like playing any other games out .
Doesn't run Freezes up on my Android device. I want a refund.
Frequently Update. It's always asking for update after couple of days. It's showing incorrect last seen. Call quality is very very poor. Always receive echo from another side.
Rigged You can be 1000 up and lose. It's set up so you have to buy chips.  5.49 down the toilet is better than losing all the time.
Timer doesn't work I've bought a couple different items that take time to get but the timer doesn't work. Says I must be connected to a network. Which I am both Mobil and WiFi. Energy won't refill so now I'm stuck... Fix you stuff Glu Uninstalling
Won't work It won't work you are probably disapponting lots of children fix it really
Looks neat, kinda sucks This is a sometimes works sometimes doesn't app.
 Nothing wrong with it. I just dont have enough space, but I cant get a refund. Please help me. Does anyone hear me I dont want to live with the fact that I lost 6 bucks to a game I cant play.
Doesn't work since nexus update
It says you have 10 numbers left, but in reality it doesn't give you all of them... You'll see the numbers left drop really fast and only 1 or 2 numbers were actually called
Terrible Not as fun as Hill Climb Racing. Could be a lot better,terrible graphics.
need up date lags and comnection error good game just lags
Zero stars.  Was unable to download additional content on my Nexus 6. Tried multiple WiFI connections and my LTE data network.  Cleared data and uninstalled app and tried again. Still no go. Would like my money back.
The worst This app is really bad BC it would never lode for me to play.
Update it It runs slow on my galaxy tab, i really want to plays this
This game sucks I only played 3 lvls and it asked for money for more lvls on that stupid game NEVER DOWNLOAD THIS STUPID GAME
It was a great game They seem to have spoiled a very good game with a dreadful graphics upgrade. 5 stars to 2. Awful.
Where did the bonus go I used to get a returning bonus flip game everyday and it would increase the number of flips each day. Now I only get a bonus every 4 hours. Fix and I'll give 5 stars.
Terrible game
Fix for androids The game does not want to open up and I feel it was a waste of my money. I had it on my iPod a long time ago and had no problems. You need to fix this and,i would happily give it a 5 star rating and play it.
Doesn't work well And since last update you never win many coins.  Fat chance I'd ever pay for coins
So bad This is a shining example of how to apply no effort to making a game. The results is something so poor it's bad value even when it's free.
singstar mic it will load but it won't find my ps3 that's on the same network .. for some strange
Uupgrade The old version is better. Problems with the spins. You can't see the.   9Bb bonus amount , and since the upgrade I can't use my tablet at all with the game. It starts to upload and stops at 55. Seems as if the game has corrected it self
Worst Alteast make the umpires give right decision they never take a reveiw for opponent team. My all lofted shots turn into catches but opponent team always hits long sixes of 85 metres
Bombs out for full round scoring Always bombs out when scoring a full round. Lose all my scores. Could be such an awesome app but lots of work needed. Better to just go on your mobile browser and do everything there.
Utter Crap Since the last update everything has all messed up. This used too be an awesome app but now the quality of the recorded footage is garbage 0 stars. PLEASE FIX
It doesn't work It keeps turning off as soon as I press play If it doesn't get fixed I'm going to uninstall it.

Force Closes When trying to sprinkle... Pretty lame for a paid app. Please fix.
Just the same thing over and over. Too over stimulating.  Would not consider this an educational game at all. Toca boca has much better learning games

WASTE OF MONEY This app is a simple soundboard. Was expecting all types of instruments that are emulated. Wish i could get my money back
Good Since
Crashing Crashing on level 17 in exact same place 4 times. Will upgrade star when fixed. Can't keep playing otherwise.
Worthless Barley gives you money to play. They want you to use your card to buy coins. The only thing that's good about the game is its exactly like the casino end of story. I will be uninstalling worst game i put on my phone.
Ad's are too big Can't play games because ads are taking over the screen
IT WONT WORK When i tap the app, my screen goes black and then back to my apps, like it wont even work If i could give negative stars i wouldn't hesitate to do so.
Freezing Freezes up in level four. Went through it three times and it kept doing the same thing. Screen goes a shaky and words going across the screen. Spent a dollar that I want back but no refund option. Thanks a lot.
Ads are bad for toddlers. Don't load unless you are prepared to sit and take off ads so your child can play
Boring We can't take x we have to take only o so don't download it and don't waste your time

Bingo fail I have been on this game for several days and it still has me on day 1 on daily prizes. Also when I play the jackpot before rounds it takes more coins than it claims. Please fix
Too much adds  slow money Played almost half game but still can't afford most of the equipments. Too meny adds create a disturbance
To easy Need to make 10m won. Level is too easy. If someone go bankrupt game shouldn't finish just all cards and many goes to the bank and game continues.
Where's ifunny  Not even close to beating ifunny.
Doesn't scan. No accounting for lighting or natural blurglare Held over QR codes trying  to scan with no success at an outdoor screen for 20 minutes before giving up.
Nasty adware inside... ... as detected by SeCore Antivirus. Shame, for a paid app  Aux devs cessez de nous prendre pour des cons

Stupid I have to keep making new account cause it keeps loging me out and wont let me login again even tho im typing the right email and password. Please fix this

Confusing As title of app suggests family finder could really work it out to find out family instead it gets access to my mobile phone camera call details images my privacy is getting ready to be public by this app
Time Waste Play less,adds more.some time strucks the game.don't waste you time
I wasted my money on this stupid game Every time I open the app it tells me license error I did what it told me to do and it kept saying the same thing FIX THAT OR GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK
From what I remember of this game you could tap once to see how many points the grouping got you and tap again to pop.  Easier to get higher scoring groupings.  Also, I hate the flashing.
Lollipop Crash Great game before but doesn't work with lollipop. Please fix soon.
TOO MANY ADS I had to un install a few of my other apps to download this game. Started of fun but TOO MANY ADS After completing 1 or 2 levels another ad will pop up. Please fix this and I will rerate this game. Disappointed
Winter Craft I HAD 40 DIAMONDS THEN THE GAME DECIDED TO QUIT I LOST MY DIAMONDS THAT TOOK ME 5 HOURS
GREAT Graphics BUT... game play is cool, love the graphics, it's boring  due to the fact, you have to upgrade your bow in challenge mode too much  impossible to get coins without paying real cash smh

Was a great game but has issues to often plus I changed phones and had to start all the way over even though I'm logged in to my Google account and I've attempted to contact the developers but received no response
Don't down load or purchase and scratchers or bonus rolls. You want receive them. I just a purchase of 35 bonus rolls for 9.99 and didn't receive them. So I got screwed out of money and that ain't right.
Pas de statistique avec amis

5 stars when fixed I've been emailing Disney through this app, they are working on the game and know it is having issues.
NO SAVE BUTTON PLEASE FIX
Looks free BUT you have to pay after afew levels Is fun game but is ruined by deceitful beginnings suggesting it is free when its only a taster to get people to pay.  Just make it a paid app Too much advertising.

Love you guys on fb but this is a pretty useless app. Sorry

Used to be a good app This used to be a good app, however it's become very buggy. I cannot get it to start tracking until I am already on the road for five to ten minutes. Hope they fix that soon.
No longer updated Works like crap on my Samsung S5. The bottom of the screen gets cut off. I can't post or reply or set any as favorites.  Apparently it is no longer being updated.

Connectivity It keeps saying that I'm not connected to Internet but I have WiFi and good service and have tried using both. Frustrating.

Starts up on Boot Hate that it starts up on device boot. It drains battery plus a pop up appears everytime you unlock the device saying Sneaker Crush has stopped working.  I prefer the old version of this. No more New Lead downloads ever.

Error on start up I downloaded and installed it a few times on my tablet but each time it throws an exception and go fixed on the sims logo I really love this game please fix it
Crap Quite possibly the worst piece of shit I have ever had the misfortune of installing. Nothing like the real deal and is basically just a terrible app all together  I would give it less than 1 star
The app sucks since i paid to upgrade The Facebook sharing hasn't worked once.  There was no problem when I had the regular version.  This sucks.  I want my money back.

Every game crashes I've never had a problem with apps crashing, but this one crashes constantly.  It also often won't let me play with the expansion I paid for.  Not worth it because I can seldom finish a game.
It ok It not that fun
If power shot is taken and it is a no or wide ball same should not be deducted
Sad. The last update caused me to loose my progress. Well today I updated it again thinking hey, I might get my stuff back I didn't. I am really disappointed that I didnt. I loved this game and hope you can fix this 
Wow this is one of the worst apps  ever made all I could see is a blue and white helicopter floating in the middle of my ipad screen
All those spam identifiers for telemarketers and still getting calls after blocking them. I have over 500 on my list and it is not stopping. Your updates aren't solving anything.

Hey what happened  Free version worked just fine, purchased premium version and it keeps saying no playback video found No play icon Help or refund me
Flawed update Since the last update, I'm unable to scroll down on my phone past 2 or 3 postings. Something got screwed up. Hope they release a fix soon. This is annoying.

Just purchased this game. Can anyone explain why i cannot even open it My internet connection is doing great.. and i can't even make a refund.

Totally bullshit.not working well.half or last of the match it restart again or stop automatically.I hate this game nd now going to uninstall.want to fuck bloody person who maked this app
Causing many problems App is slowing the phone and interferring with nova launcher on Galaxy S Cyanogenmod. Causing also other problems. I will go with the free version, which is a great app.
Terrible Luckily I was able to get a refund.
Sucks This game has no aiming. If you make it go one way it doesn't go  ends up going to the wrong place. Not a very fair game.
Not bad App badhiya hai . Lekin app open hone ke baad back hone ka koi option maujud nahi hai . Isliye ise ekdam achha nahi kaha ja sakta hai .
It's too childish , like a freaken 2yr old can play it
JUNK Worked for a week and poorly at best ..Now my son opens it and does nothing but aggravate him.
How to Get Friend It really confusing me,, I and my sister try it but cannot connect,,
Poor  intraction
Missing a very common option. Only lets you turn single card. Better apps let you choose three card turn for more challenging play.
Poor No.use fake ids are more its use paid members only
Can't play game Paid for this expecting to at least be able to play it with mabye a bit of lag but no I cant even get to the main menu for that to even happen it just crashes when the grass starts to roll on the loading page Sort it out
Can't drag off screen When you play and try to drag the weapons on the screen it will not allow you to place weapons on the very bottom, making it impossible to create a maze for the field runners.
No Google cloud save Sorry but it's one star until you learn to value your customers time and multi device setups. Tired of lazy developers.
I love the repeated crashes and ads ads ads A little gameplay, long ads, oops,crashed, restart and bang more ads, start playing and repeat . Bad form, Rovio, bad form.
Shocking Always crashes when I try to enter scores, never makes it through one round to enter scores hole by hole, report the crashes every time but the developer fixes nothing.
Stupid app Not lock screen only time pass hated it very bad app
Crap Really wanted to play this on my tablet but havent got enough space i just put in a 6gb external memory card if i cant install i want my money back now

No movie houses When selecting theatres, it does not show any if the theatres. I can not book any movies via the app and can not see movie times. It did work before the upgrade on my huawei. I had to download the tablet app for a app that works
Too many advertisement..pop up disturbs the fun Once done, it then pop up an advertisement. This is not good  and kill off the fun. Some advertisement is not suitable for children. So frustrating
 Used to love this game but i cant acces to my saved game anymore dont feel like starting new game  from scratch again
Not Player Friendly Understood rules  the game yet tiles matched would not disappear and too much time spent figuring the matching was futile. Uninstalled.
App Freezes If I could give this zero 's I would Game stops working and then causes my phone to freeze. Only way to fix it is to take out the battery and reboot my phone. UNINSTALLING
It sucks I can't even put my finger print in. This is stupid. And it needs a hell of a lot of work
Update ruined the game After the update,  the screen stays black and won't even start the game
Nice It's really help you. To increase the knowledge about all field
Deluxe hotel dash Played once then can't retrieve it any more..have tried to play game..but never.open up anymore I don't recommended this game...
We need multiplayer please and thank you You need to add multi player this game would be so much better and I'll rate rate 5 stars and if there was more stars I would rate more but it needs multiplayer
Nuicence........ Run by stupid ppl....not available at any pin code....other shopping apps far far better......I recommend not install such app....earlier it was good......hate it
Ads There ads everywhere. FIX IT Don't download it
Would give better I love this game but since the last update I can't play. Will give 5 star if they can fix that problem
This ain't very fair. I truly am hating this game right now. The dealer got 17 Blackjacks in a row and I lost all my money I lost 47 Hands in a row. Not one blackjack for me. What's going on... Is the game rigged
It was fun but, I need to pay, to play more
couldn't even get past the first mission because of a glitch where the controls wouldn't show up. So so so disappointed because it looks really good and I love batman
Doesn't work Keeps freezing up have to forceclose. Its not worth the money. Getting g refund.
So dumb. .... Only 4 memory game pictures and rest we need to buy and only few colours available next in colouring game only 2 those are animals and transportation others we need to buy I can only tell plz don't install it .......... I hate this
Error after update I couldnt view anyones snaps so uninstalled then reinstalled but all my friends have a snap from me that is just a black screen that wont clear and wont go so they cant see any snaps from me and they cant send me anything
Game constantly crashes No point starting the game because once you get into it the game constantly fails to load and stay connected. 
Ish It was fun until I reached level 8, then I couldn't go any further.
RUBBISH It wont let me pick up any items also it freeves and lags.
Not working Not showing up in the widget drawer for sense 5
it was good Now I can't open the game. And I already paid for the full game. Either you fix it or refund me.
0 stars This game is crap, go find a new career if u can
Categories missing Where are my 5 star categories gone Movies and TV shows I've completed and they've gone. It says to unlock Reality TV I have to complete TV but it's not unlocking WTF
Too much ads 60 page is full of ads..hate it.
Good
Can't connect Cant connect to Facebook on mobile or tablet cant create an account whats the point if i cant play against mates it is literally pointless
I paid for this hassle Yes I did. The app crashed 3  times while installing and has yet to run successfully on my granddaughter's NuVision Intel tablet.  Let me know when you update it because my granddaughter would like to play it.
Cloud saves I play on my LG G4 and I want to play on my LG G Pad 8.3 and it's forcing me to start a new game when I'm signed into my Google play profile and it says in game description that there's cloud saves.
won't work on any samsung device won't get past the loading content screen
It's ok. But can be better. You can't multi touch to make cool sounds sooo. Yeah What I said
Summary page after rounds Why are the bottom of the tiles cut off making the tiles unreadable. E's look like F's , L's look like I's Q looks like O. You really can't read that little board.
Good App but now crashes on launching. I am having the exact same problem as reported by user Rupert Brun and have followed the same steps with the same result.  It has been running fine up till now.
Doesn't run properly Opens up, shows me the EULA and won't go further than that. No buttons to click, no swipe to a new page to get past it. Nothing
How is this even pegi 3
Doesn't work How's the app meant to protect me if it doesn't work
Irritating When I am clearly connected to strong as fuck WiFi, the app says that there isn't an internet connection. Hence the app is great but insanely irritating.
You don't even play the things
Started ok But fighting the first big boss for keys past plains and getting killed, means starting level all over. No save point there. And whats with the bigger than life bats that knock you Into the spikes or off ledges Not fun anymore.
Do not work in my tablet Start page comes but do not start when cklick on it
Hate it It's lame and it sucks Mostly hate the auto rotation feature, which makes the app crush sometimes
Bullshit Crap crap crap
Game sucks, says swipe down and when I do it doesn't work
C'mon Ok so i bought the whole game and I was expecting to be able to play as all three crocs but I was only able to play as swampy really if you buy the whole game you should be ble to play as all three crocs
Stupid retarded makes no sense
Payment Getting a bank interface timeout error
Error Ever since the new update, I can't use snapchat it can't access my camera, please fix it and then I'll give it a better rating.  Nexus 5
I wish my review would let me post a screenshot.  The game will put two x's forcing me to lose
Please fix Game won't even work. Wasted my 8 year old's 7 bucks. Hope fix is done soon otherwise the maker should be sanctioned for selling an app that doesn't work.
Keeps Crashing. Every time I try to play a movie, The app says Unfortunately BrainPOP has stopped, Please fix this issue. I have projects due.
Problems on lollipop Sounds do only work partially on Android 5.0 other than that a nice little toy

Doesn't work in Mauritius
ZombieVilleUSA I really like this game but when i try to go to the next level it takes a long time.. also when  i go in a door sometimes i cant get out 
Blind It seems like an awesome game, but i cant see anything but shadows. Also the game closes out every 2nd or 3rd mission. Plz fix
Peshawar
Fun but The game always crashes on me and it glitches so i blend it fast
Good You can play online.
Kaufversion ist der gleiche mist Doofe programmierer
Where is my trophies Phone froze and had to reset it. Lost my games and the rewards I won while playing it even though it connected to Google. Why bother having it connected if it don't keep track of your results properly.
Won't work Love the game on my phone but I can't seem to get it to work on my Nexus 9
Don't get it When u finish where is the next button
Trutle time issues Keeps shutting down and returing me to my home screen everytime I reach turtle time. Its super annoying and for a paid game shouldn't happen.
What the stuff The new update WAS awesome until it reset and took all my stuff Worse yet it happened in the middle of a run Just went to the home screen, wiped out all my money, upgrades and slopes This sucks
2 things Add in lifeanimals including tameable ones...... A save button........... And more blocks like TNT....... Its all creative mode add a survival mode.                     You'll get a 5 if u fix it

Bad Graphics very Bad...The game is very slow Too
I love circket
Does not work See title
Could be fun My only issue with this game is how it's plagued by matchmaking issues. You're constantly matched against players at a much higher level than you. It gets very old very fast.
Just black I open the game and I can hear music, but no menu shows up. I am on a motorolla xoom, and that may not be the best tablet, but my iPod  4 could handle it, this should too
Un install Couldn't play as it kept taking me to an advert and crashing when I said 'no' to rating them  wanted to play it first. Well, they wanted a rating so they've got one. It's rubbish. Un installing it now......
Doesn't  Work . I just purchased  one  of the  coloring  books and it wont download  or allow me to sync my printer so I can print out the pages for my son. Can I get my money  back or am I just  screwed  ou of my cash

Major flaw introduced... Unable to swipe to next news article. Somebody wasn't paying attention
Love it but Love the game but it seems to have slowed down and the only way to get better equipment is to pay money.....not coo
Glitches forever Now with newest update, there is a stupid alert that wont go away in my message bar of my phone.
Great but won't install lollipop My kid loves this but it disappeared after I upgraded to lollipop and now it won't install. Hopefully Peg can solve this problem.
Its good but it doesn't shows the new junction Mandi House and new station ITO. Plz fix that and also check for others...

Deigned for tablets This is a half added port. Please make optimize this for QHD tablets. Performance and menus issues on dell venue 8 7840
Rubbish It keeps saying check your internet connection and saying error, my internet connection is fine. Ive downloaded this 3 times yet it continues to say error
Wont even connect to my camera The app doesn't function properly on certain phones. I will rate 5 stars if the bugs are fixed.
Buggy It was great when the app actually worked, but the majority of the time I experienced freezing, inability to play even downloaded episodes, and random crashes.
Cant log in...
Money back I want my money back

Won't open on nexus player, installed fine Any ideas

I don't like this app I wanted to do a puzzle  and u had to buy it  I don't like it
Needs fixed please I paid for this game and now i can't play it as the button to control spiderman has gone, was good til that happened
Long wait times Waiting for fuel to replenish takes forever, unless you buy gold which defeats the purpose of free gaming at a certain point it becomes no fun
Install issues. The game refuses to upgradeinstall on my Samsung Galaxy SIIx Hercules.  The only change from stock is an os bump, and it has upgraded since the pushout.  Otherwise I think the game is stellar, playing it on my Motorola Xoom WiFi.
I LOVE IT  Well this is much better but what did you say was true because is  kind of boring
Virus All these new improvements and u can't fix the fact your notifications make it impossible to do anything on your phone for 10 min. I have turned off notifications both in game and in settings and still have notifications. Virus
Before it was okay,  but know i cant get the daily challenges  when I lose the game .. i have to restart this app to start another game.. plz fix it
hate it,don't git It had two things to do with the dog Ben and the cattom   doesn't have nothing you have to unlock it and adds are to much and       
Waste of time. Inaccurate departure times. Slow to update bus positions. No refresh button.
Bug I tried loading my cloud saved character, and it says that the file it was saved on was on a newer version of terraria and wont be able to load him. Im done with this game, I've lost too many worlds and characters.
Doesn't work. I get some 3s rendering issue. On a Nexus 6
I will love it if It would load. It will finally get in the game then all it does is says connecting. I sat there for about 30 minutes and it would not load. I will 5 star it if it will load. Please give me tips so I can play it. 
It takes forever to calibrate itself to the correct direction. I end up turning it off before I get to find what I am looking for. Just waiting for my subscription to end next April. Will not renew if it does not get fixed.
Not good
Annoying Was okay until I went back on my game and had to do things all over again after just doing them and I also can't battle keeps saying failed, on the verge of just getting rid please sort it out as I like the game
Doesn't work on HTC One Lollipop So far this only worked for me using a friends Samsung S4. Have a HTC One M7 Google Play Edition and didn't work. Also failed on LG G2.
I kinda liked it but then... I liked the idea but I was having trouble figuring out how to play then I downloaded the updates and now it won't open or load

I might as well unistall At this point there is no point in having a snap chat. With the new update stories won't load and the camera is so slow i give up on trying to send a pic half the time. Goodbye snap chat, Hello Pariscope
Fails to load stages In line with a lot of other reviews, after stage 2 of Australia the games fails to load any more stages. Effectively I've bought a two stage demo. Needs addressing please before I'll review again.
It was perfect, but I don't know, right know whenever i open this app, it just gave me black screen, is it not compatible to lolipop Bcause when I use kitkat it just fine
Refund I downloaded it then it couldn't download then it didn't give me a refund now I don't have thhe game and I hardly have anymore spending money. I wouldn't recommend it strongly because pet world is rubbish
Bpk gamee
Used to work, but... Not on my Sony Xperia Z1 Compact with Android 5.0.2. Location changes to an unknown place randomly. Sunrise and sunset changes randomly. Weather tempature is often off by 20 degrees or more. No longer a functional app.
Unfair play Won't work on Lollipop, yet free version works no problem. Think it's unfair play that there is an option to purchase a no ads version of that one... Why can't you fix this one for those that purchased it already
Their only two unlock.
The lasers sont come put of the camera they just r on the screen and all u do is click a button and lasers pop up on screen.
Stupid Couldn't select where you was throwing or what routes your guys ran and no speed burst or jump on defense to intercept

Waste of money You cannot expect your perfect match from this site, please ignore if they approach to  you.
Good but.......... The picture quality of the game is too low. So pleade do some favour for me.
IF YOU HAVE A GALAXY.... I only downloaded this so i could put up this reveiw, for those of you who want it back, IF YOU HAVE AN ANDROID DEVICE i found Ifunny on the galaxy store. Search for it on the home page and it'll come up

Ari Kutvonen After update to 1.5 crash after 15 seconds. Map mosaic, not useful. No airspace or reporting points visible.
PVP NOT FAIR The PvP always pairs you up with someone who has a way higher PR than yours. How can you manage to beat someone when they have all ultras vs your rares Please make some modifications
I actually like playing this game but it keeps freezing. Hve uninstalled and reinstalled game which deleted my progress. Have sent you an email. If it continues i will no longer be playing
Doesn't work Says I have no connection but obviously I do if I'm typing this
Incomprehensibly frustrating A game that has the basic but only succeeds in making you want to smash your mobile device. Units are limited. Health is rationed. Progress is slower than a turtle. Erased from my phone.
Can't post pictures Can only post pictures from device and not Google pictures or drive. Most of the time viewing a profile I get an Oops screen with jumbled cables.  No response from developer yet... Is anyone even looking at these reviews
Hate this game Everytime I try to set it up or whatever it send me something like unfortunately mancala isn't working at this moment
Wtf I was about to buy 150 diamonds for 99 cents when my Internet went out. It said I had an hour. When I got back on, less than a minute later, it was gone. Now it's fullprice.
No holiday switching. No holiday switching. Even on the website.  And the call centre is a dead end as well.

Not good for people with epilepsy,  very glitchy and rubbish game overall also the glitching gets really annoying when playing dont download its useless
Not happy I thought this was a Free text and call App but when u send text messages it takes minutes away like a track phone Absolutely hate that about this App not everyone can afford to pay for min. It should be all Free since it says free text app
Does this app also have an antivirus Also does it have an anti theft or something
Idiocy. Such a waste. I'd like a refund for this ridiculousness. I would've given more stars if you simply NAMED THE ELEMENTS. Such a massive flaw This is just a mindless tool to keep toddlers antibored.
This game is waste Can't control us
Vvvveeerrryyyy baad Plz con't download in PKP bannu

Can't access the the app I can't access the app even if i use my id number
Won't load I sent an email to the company about it never loading and I still haven't received a response. I loved their previous game and I like to try this one

It keeps freezing up. Update please everytime I go on the tournament's it freezes and takes my tokens and doesn't give me mt prize.
Ehh Hate the fact that I have to sign in anytime the app closes if I want to keep track of what I have done. Not nearly the amount of quizzes on the site. Should have read the reviews before purchasing. Still fun though.

Please fix this... Why shouldn't we be able to sync to another BTD5 profile so that we don't have to start ALL over again and upgrade... I would rate it 4 or 5 stars, but I don't think it's worth rating this game that high when we have to restart...
Crap The questions are stupid and are too complicated, only Einstein can do this

Crashing It won't stop crashing. 
Bugs out It worked the first two days and then never worked again.  It will start up for five seconds and then freeze and close.  I am not happy about this especially since they will not return my money.
I swear i will refund if it doesnt get fixed ASAP The app is ALWAYS asking me to GO PRO wth Ive already bought it and features are working but EVERYTIME I EXIT out of the app then go back it wants me to purchase
App for Idiots App for Idiots

Trying to change the God's word Used to love this app but since recent updates, there are 45 verses taking out and words taking out of it. God's word still stands true regardless of what is taking out.
IS THE GAME FREE The game is not free if YOU have to pay for things
Quickly Uninstalled This is a pathetic attempt at arrow words. A lot of the clues are unnecessary one letter words.
Good but stupid Glitches  stupid bad game
disliked this game very  much...you cant swap out shooter colors and very seldom will the shooter go where it's aimed...just not fun like many other bubble games
So good V v i apps

Freezes a lot The game looks fun but it freezes up everytime we press the make believe button. Pretty much unplayable.

Ads in paid version I've had the paid version for a while and it was fine. Haven't played in a year or so and started playing recently. Now there are ads for different games. Great game but don't like the ads for a paid version.
I found this really useful checking train updates, why is this feature gone make some changes for As for the other Wear features,
Too quick Come on.. Only nine rooms. And it doesn't even show you that you've broken out at the end. To easy. Much more levels please or we riot
      . 
Sorry guys I gave it an honest amount of time and patience, but the game was way to one sided towards the house. Your graphics are great. Good luck. Maybe I will check back later to see if the game play has improved
 Whatever happened in the latest update, booooooo. Crashes every time I try to open. Phone reboot and a uninstallreinstall both do nothing
such a great game from you guys . but it keeps crashing on my Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime after few minutes of playing . please fix it and i'll rate 5 . tnx

Theme problem Most of times as game starts board goes black, only pieces are visible but not the squares. Thats why i have to abort lot of games before it even big inns and lose my rating. Please fix this issue this is very frustating.

It wont let me open it Tf this game might be very amazing but idk why tf wont it let me open the game
Post update After the recent update, it has a lot of crashing issues. Its unfortunate to say because the game was a lot of fun when i first got it. Hopefully they fix the crashes, until then its not even worth a download.
A purchased the premium version, and it makes all videos upside down on my nexus 6. Fantastic. Piece of app.
Total bs I had 4 aces and still..... Lost
Crashes on high settings on galaxy s6, the most powerful device now. Just pitiful.
Make playing field larger. Too tiny.
Amazing how difficult Novice be ware  Physics and planes are very well done.  Unless you are a airline pilot you will be confused.

Free Chip You guys know I'm not spending cash on something that's not tangible right ..   you guys are better over loading the app with ads RealShit
Samsung Galaxy S2 App keeps freezing and closing out every single time I open it and pick a picture. I would like this fixed ASAP as I did pay for it. Im getting extremely frustrated.

Htc desire x I bought this 4 my daughter and all i get is a black screen
Awesome Games is awesome would of given higher points but after recent update anything after level 16 wont open. Uninstalled several times and reinstalled but still no dice. Guess gunna have to unstall permanently.
All questions aren't in English I'd probably get the questions if they were English, and there's no way too change it Would of enjoyed it if I knew other languages
Fix some problems Can not watch any videos in Thailand, but can access the mainpage. Please fix it...
Doesn't work on my device. Nothing says it won't. Give my money back. I just want my money back. The game isn't supported and that is not my fault.
Will not work Had it for less than a month and now the screen freezes. It will load but the game never begins the icons just sit there. Reloaded twice same result.
Buggy. Could have been a useful app. After a few times it won't allow you to continue without rating it and even after rating it the nagpop won't go away so the kid just cannot color anymore
Tad upset... Now unable to upload videos without logging into and giving full access to my youtube account, don't always want to upload to youtube,such a shame as tweetcaster is a really good app.

Used to work really well but now can't even get to pick a character. Such a shame as daughter loved it and found its the best paintingdrawing app for kids about
... Was great originally but since the update keeps crashing and has to close so can't use it any more. 
Connection issues.. Cant connect FB and or Google. No option to add those clients, otherwise this app is useless for me.
Won't load I open the app put it keeps kicking me out of it. Don't waste your timespace
Cheats you out of money on cascading games This game keeps getting worse and worse. When you play the cascading games they randomly stop while you are on a win streak and stop cascading even though it clearly should continue. What a joke.
Update is more of a downgrade. Takes 5 minutes to recruit basic units...  Wtf, was 1 minute before. I'm sick of waiting, we want action not standby time.
Boring Absolutely the dumbest game ever
Crashed when opening Game wouldn't start. Refunded.
It gud BT u CNT do your own thing.u use what in there.
What happened This app used to be GREAT.  Along came an update and 1. I can't save tracks,  only  pause or clear.  2. GPS  doesn't work.  No speed,  no location,  nothing  Only the clock is working.
Save your , game does not work
Borin Needs more levels characters and is alright if you want to waist time
Did not install correctly, then no refund. Don't bother with it.
The ad The game play that you see in the trailer is from a highly superior game called Mount and Blade Warband for pc, it's like 10 dollars on steam, go get that instead
Crash The app crashes every time I try to refine the list. Lollipop 5.1.1
Sound If I can't turn off sound I don't like it. And it ran slow like it was buffering
 Avoid this app.  Way to much access required for what it is.  And it dont work correctly.  I think someone has spent more effort trying to get your info than making this work .
To bad
MONEY HUNGRY Pay for Gold, Gems, VIP, XPcalled Haste. Doing this gives you AMAZING gear, higher levels, more boss tries, etc. If you like emptying your wallets, this game is for you.
It  is  not  good... When  I  was  installing  this  I  was  so  happy  for  my  son  but  after  that  I  feel  like  it  is  so  simple  that  a  student  learned  all  these  things  in  preparation nursery ...
since the new update the game loads halfway then it cuts off. I can't play the game at all. Once you fix this issue I will give 4 stars.
Ads are always popping up
Weak A better looking but worse version of a game by a similar name.  Tons of cars There's like 7. Pass

Overpriced I get a 15 Google play card and pay 5 for game, and I don't have enough for the season pass Wtf 20 for a phone game is just ridiculous.
Rip off Worked but in a few days it didn't work any more
Refund May I please have a refund I'm not trying to be mean. I like the game and all, but it wouldn't download because of an error. I already spent my money on it. Thanks
Repetitive I usually enjoy your games but this felt like one hidden object game after another. Boring.
Ads Everywere crash, Slow loading , ngga ada menu searchfind , yang utama iklan nya terlalu banyak  Gambarnya ngga nampil sama sekali ,
Time limit Time limit per question is very less
Alphabet Only having a few letters before asking you to pay for the remaining alphabet.
Useless Why is SAGA for free and I have to pay for this app Why does it say for free when i can'nt even lock in for free
Fun
While the app works fine . its not user friendly. Its a game , sure. The coin spins barely give you enough to spend. Its not worth the money to buy coins when I can go blow it on the real game at the casino
Worst game ever Uninstalling it right now.. Poor graphics and lot of advertisements........ I would suggest never to download this game......
Poor Its  not workin for my two son tablet an I paid for this app
Really get the words right It's ti not si I uninstalled it because I don't want my children to learn the wrong words. It was a nice colorful and musical app for children but the wrong word ruins it. Fix it and I would use the app.

Hated it When this game was in my mobile, I opened it and I did not saw the title, I saw a horrible ghost with pumpkin head. Please fix it. It was horrible.HORRIBLE
I hate this app everytime I get so far on the game it kicks me off
Not worth a dollar Let's you see your ghost followers but doesn't let you unfollow them. Problem refreshing. It sucks
Good game, but it keeps crashing. Game keeps crashing since downloading waterloo.  AI is a little better since update, but not nearly good enough for a challenge
Dont download I thought you were supposed to help her give birth but guess not
Refund please. It won't work on Gear S    fix that and you're awesom. Otherwise refund please. I love the design though.
Why use tokens I like the actual game, but I don't like that you get so few tokens and you can play 2 games and then have to wait hours to play again.
It lags big time, extremely irritating It doesn't react on time, it takes forever to get to tag a song, the interface is unbelievably laggy... very annoying experience. It used to work smoothly. Not anymore.
Connectivity sucks ..   ...   Shld  updated soon
Horrible If I were you I would not waste time on this. It would not let me play. It would not let me play without saying you have to buy that
When are you going to fix the font size change The font is always getting bigger and smaller. So annoying

Galaxy s6 active Stories will start but they will lag extremely and I can't view them. On all stories not just some.

I keep falling through the ground and dying and it doesn't allow me to turn and jump sometimes and I'm tired of the stupid apps that pop up out of no where I want this game fixed It doesn't even deserve a single star fix it before I uninstall it
It wont work
I am on last word and it keeps reverting to the play  button, back to the puzzel, repeatedly. I don't know if I can get to another game. I can't finish the current one.
Very bad No details for Kerala , TamilNadu.. This app is ment for only below listed state. Andrapradesh , Bangalore , Chattisharh , Delhi, Chandigarh, Madhya Pradesh,Odisha , Tripura.  I am going to un install it right away
Was 5 Until when i open the game i get a TIPS11 Connection error. Fix a x 5 again other than that, great game

Jungle marbles It is messed up on 2nd level the marbles are not even in the track
Got boring very quickly Got boring very quickly
Rubbish App isn't intelligent to suggest alternate routes but wants you to go through heavy traffic just because the route is faster.  It's no time saver and it's no Google Navigate. Far far far away.
Jinxed Can't help but think it's jinxed a little so you keep losing a level until you but power ups to help you pass, been stuck on level 18 for ages sighs
Not working Can log in on the web with email and password but does not work on the smartphone or tablet. Has to be this logon app Doesnt work in either dstv now or box office
Its ok Its not a bad game but its just not for me. All the hunting games they put out are the same game. Need to mix it up some and not just change what we are hunting for.
Keeps crashing my phone. Fun game but now every few rounds the app stops and my phone freezes on the error screen to the point that I have to take my battery out to reset. Only app that gives me this issue.
Extremely buggy While I love the service, the app is really buggy. Lots of issues with playback, offline mode, and Chromecast streaming. I have sent a mail listing all the bugs. I hope they are fixed soon.
Ummm not sure.... All I have so far for 9.99 is an app that goes to a white screen. Hoping something else happens.
Just ok. Really wanted to like it, but very hard to get enough coins for upgrades. Bored with only 1 stage, even though I'm upgraded to 11 on the jeep.  Uninstalling and going back to original fingersoft version.
App won't open Downloaded, won't open. Uninstall and reinstalled, same issue. Don't waste your time downloading until it's fixed
Great game but lost login info We love the game but somehow got logged out and now nothing will log us back in 
So many 30 sec ads Would be a great game if it weren't for the 30 second video ads every min.
What happened I keep get app crashes when tying to set auto saved and saved widgets on new update...Also does not change bit maps any more Please fix
aww game
It shouldn't say free.... should rather say inapp purchases. Mxm. Immediately uninstalled
Scaling issues UI elements are much smaller than they should be and some text are not legible. Please fix this scaling issues on higher resolution devices. Using Samsung Galaxy S6
Frustrated Can't seem to download the app.  Paid for it, have huge data allowance and good reception, but alas, stuck on 88.
No notifications Since I updated the app I haven't received a single notification On my other devices with older versions they come through just fine. What gives Please fix or I'll have to use a different app
Mo current round  scores Cannot see the score of the current round. Pretty annoying.
terrible on my phone cant read the words and it wont load anything on my tablet
Lucky it's free Thought a laser shoots out. It doesn't, not cool man. The youngster will let the sound fx though.
Kids love the show Hate the game.  You have to use the tilt feature.  And it sucks. I'm a 40 year old man been gaming since I was ten and i can get it to work right.  Should be free but nope 3 bucks.  Very disappointed.  And so are my kids.
Note 3 Controls are not precise enough to make it enjoyable. Make you feel it is more luck than skill. All in all not my cup of tea. Wasted money.
DONT DOWNLOAD IT I didnt even play any thing its soooooooooooo slow it does not even load I waited for like 30 mints and it didnt load HATE IT I'm deleting it
Crashes on kitkat
Does not open on Note3 after the upgrade.
Bugs. The pop up screens to cook food is much too large for my phone so i cannot even read half of it... I am dissapointed
When there are 2 flowers the word comes as floers but when  worm is there it comes as worms. No singular plural...
Hate it One room,really
Pile of garbage Half the time you can't check in to play, then it force stops every time you go to turn off the timer. Some of the worst programming I've seen in an app. Ever.
Chromecast no work no more
Boring Its very confusing and I think it is trying to be like Mine craft but its not. You can only build cubes and blocks because there is no furniture to make a house with. Little children may enjoy it though.
Zynga Rigged game don't play it. Waste of time Don't play it
Sucks I can't listen to it
WTH When it works it's Awesome, but lately after every update this app is sinking. If an update happens to fix one issue there's no time for celebration because it's guaranteed that about 3 other things are about to go wrong.
Very cool game Over a year later and no updates, no bug fixes, pathetic.
Steals all the money payouts crap
Immediately UNinstalling before I throw my phone. Absolutely a nightmare. Too bad it ruins a fairly playable game. Go ahead... you'll see what I'm talking about.
Bad it takes away my letters I can't do it
HATE IT Almost everytime i win it says that the other player won
Not much to do I was very disappointed with this app. Its a little too simple and there isn't much for my two year old to do on it.
Good birds Very gud game
Game stopped letting me play After reaching level135 and finally got most things bought the application won't open it tries to open then closes
Menarik tapi tidak update Sebenarnya aplikasinya menarik... tapi sayang sepertinya developernya udah ninggalin nih app jadi sudah tidak pernah dupdate lg kayanya. Sering crash dan banyak konten yang tidak bisa dibuka.
Hated it This games is so stupid  i let my niece  play it this games is the worst.i suggest that u look at the comments on a games before getting it cuz this games is LAME             
It is impossible to win in this game.
Not working after update Was working fine but after latest update does not recognise me or allow me to register. So I lose out on points and rewards. Unfair
Crashes before it even opens on HTC One M8.
Sexy nigga aint that right I love them big booty girls
Don't like waiting so long for passes it takes too long please fix it or I'm done playing this, I lose interest if I wait too long
Stupid It won't even let me do the controls If the controls actually worked, than I would have given 5 stars.
Error 498 trying to update Fail to resolve persistent  update error
Loved it Tanzania
       ...                
Loved the first one There just isn't enough content here to justify the price. I hope they add more soon.
Really U barely get any songs and it makes u buy some vip pass. There should be a way to verify that u bought one of the games and if u did u get all the songs from that game
Do not download Worst game
I prefer the older version MUCH MORE The newer version is just like all the other games...you can't just have fun you have to go through levels...
DONT LIKE IT  WENNT LET ME PLAY THE GAME
Not working Needs lollipop support. It's been many months and still no support. This is very disappointing...
Bastards People that made it are idiots
This game does not work at all so my daughter wasted her money and is very upset. Her and I both want this refunded Game will not work Want a refund for this as it cost 3.99 and won't let her play
More ads Game is ok..not so good..irritating ads..
Couldn't play it with the ads Agree with everyone else, the ads are really annoying. The rest of the game is actually really pleasantly coded, so it's a shame.
It sucked The app was dissaponting. Most manga was unload able. The Selleck on was good but to bad most volumes are blank or poorly scanned .
Standard game Ads every 3 game,song quality poor
Crap app This is a crap app never work and crashes all the time and is stupid slow
Flop game dont waste ur time
Bought it on my Samsung S3. Then I changed to a LG G3 and I can't play the game anymore. It's not available. Please add support for the G3.
Very Cheap Try That's not rite way u promote ur app thru fake whatsapp blue updates. Ur fake ads humilates in front of friends n family network
No connection  It keeps saying I have no connection and to keep retrying but all my other apps are working and I can access Google. I've even reinstalled the app. Not happy at all
Need help I'm using Samsung s4 and it keeps going back every time I hit preferences or try to add an account. Is this a known issue I need help asap
Good except it crashes Fix the crash and it will be 5 stars
C I lost all my progress on my phone. It was not working so I had to uninstal it to work and now I lost all of it. Do you think you can get it back If so, I'll give 5 stars

Bus schedule It helps me checking the time of the next train. But it would be better if we could have the bus time too, live
Prapti Foolish thing
Disliked it
Guess the game It was stupid because I didn't know some of them
Stats not accurate, game continuously loses cards
Multiple Issues Simple spelling errors Not really practical Fell short of expectations
Horibal It is indeed horibal
Limited Levels  Not Free I enjoy these games but it gives you just a few levels then request you to buy the rest.
There is a bug  I played it 2 hours and after there was a bug so i can't walk. It's the second time it does that. Please fix it because it's my favorite game.
Unfair Game does not allow you to be first or  because when I did finish first and second it did not allow my to collect my first and second places.
Stupid graphics and boring I don't understand why did they name it Shiva when the avatar was Goku from dragon ball. Stupid background, going by the name it could have been much better
Rip off The game description said it was FREE. A four very minor games are free. They just repeat unless you BUY the full version
Booooooring, and waste of time Dont play this foolish game
Too much surge Firstly you can't find a cab. Even you find one there is a surcharge of 1.8x everytime. And then the driver takes 30 min to arrive. And of course it is too costly than UBER.
Can't skip a level.
Hated it It's so boring i feel bored when i install it don't install it it's so boring
Still the same don't waist ur time on this game
Too many ads The banners on the game are too much. I have to close ads every couple of seconds, literally.
good for children to learn
Dislike it Good piano game with good presentation, but no Google Play Game Features, no Google Cloud Sync, and misleading advertising says full version, but it isn't.
Ads and paid functions in paid version Used to be a super good game, when I tried it today I got an ad and new paid options ingame. Really poor decision from the developer who's trying to leech more money from existing paying customers.
Was grait game. but can't control car it slows down almost to a stop. Even when car stays on track. Please fix.
Good game Bad bugs Good underlying game but bugs on my nexus 7 FHD making it very hard to play. Can't place towers on the bottom row and broken zoom. If this is fixed I will re rate.
I do not lie taking up space with other people's comments
Crick3t   Ov3 Crick3t ... Nyc3 App Y
Its not work...
Functionality removed Ability to purchase OS Explorer maps  which to me is a kind of functionality  has gone from the basic version. I only bought the Pro licence to support the developer for providing this ability.
Keeps closing on my daughters m9 Plz fix I updated my daughters phone and this app still won't open on her HTC M9, can you guys please fix the bug
Way too short It was a fun game until I beat it with very little time invested.   I thought I was getting close to move to a new level and then it's over.   So sad.   It had potential but needs to be longer.
Terrible Formatting Looks like they haven't supported this app in a long time. Additionally,  I hate that there are constant ads despite having to pay for the app. Stick with tapatalk if your favorite forum supports it.
Load It will not load. 
Very bad Doesn't stay online when minimized.. Can't change my number.. Gc getting costly... I hate it now Bye
Stupid Dont download this pathetic excuse for a game
Well.... I really wish that you don't have to have a Kabam account just to log in because it won't let me. It keeps saying my email is 'Unverified' after it done said 'Verified'. Please fix
Very short easy game Should be free.  My 4 yr old got through in in 2 minutes and there's no new story or adventure.
Too many adds Please fix this every 10 seconds one pops up and then when you are choosing a song adds pop up every 5 seconds. Thank you
To large for the screen The game is impossible to use, its so big it doesn't fit on my already huge phone screen to use how is that even  fair
No offline I don't have WiFi even though I want it bad
Buggy as hell can't even save the game since nothing shows up in the menu it's pretty much all black.. and the menus are buggy too... refund pls.
Garbage Downloaded and selected new player, was told there are too many players already in my region. Doesn't have a spot to change region. Only a spot to change language. Weird that I download a game and can't even start playing it
Playing Solitare I'm disappointed w this app Worked great for a few daz but now I tap on it to play and the screen goes black. Wtf Diane Zosche
Don't waste your time Not even pay to win, this game is pay to play. You will hit a wall all of a sudden and will have to spend money to even progress any further. What a joke.
Poor statistics Having to pay 5usd to upgrade to pro version needs to meet more requirements. Statistics such as overall best avg pace or kinds of sorting them beside of date should be included.
Force Close During StartUp Its bad, pay for the apps but can't use this. This game force close during start up. Please fix it because i pay the apps.
Wanted to play Continues to crash even after update. What are you guys going to do to fix it. Won't even let me send in service ticket. Feeling ripped.
Not good Boring
Won't let me play I got a software update and it won't let me play fix it and I will rate 5 star
Bogus It's bs that you have to pay just to see who checked you out after so many views what bs. I liked this at first now it sucks as much as the others do. Maybe I should just delete it I'm not one that is gonna waste money to meet friends
ughhhh when I watch an ad to double my coin in my next run it didn't work please fix I will give 5
Yes read below It never saves my score so I always have to start over. But its addictive
BROKEN People slide on the ground and tackle you, pass Mechanic is just awful, and so is the tilt to move garbage. Horrible app.
Was working great now it works when it wants to
Doesn't work waste of time Deleted it then put it back on same thing waste of time don't even bother
Ok but You can press any key to make sounds and too little songs if you ad it ill rate 5 stars
Poor Total rip off
Stupid captcha Forgot login and can't sign up because of ridiculously illegible captchas. I must have tried about five times. It was never satisfied with my best guess. They are getting stupid hard to read.
This is not worth the money I spent on it. It is nothing like the actual Sims game.
Didn't let me download
Way too many duplicate words.
Alright This game is a waste of my time I got better games than this if u like it u r so boring to me
Ry Bought a map and it has taken the money but not unlocked it so definitely one star for that reason alone

Abe chutiya app...work on everyone's finger. Not secured...u motherfuckers
Fix the resume game button plz Works just fine till you need to exit for a call or something, the game becomes unresponsive you need to restart the whole app and lose all of your progress in the level...
RUBBISH I wouldn't even wait for it to download. It's awful, it's so glitchy and slow. It comes up with adverts all the time, to be honest I enjoy the adverts more than the game  Don't waste your time. Download something decent.
You don't get all of the stulf Bad bad bad bad bad bad
Wtf wrong note when u make a piano app make sure u have your facts straight
Don't get me wrong Don't get me wrong it's a nice game but I find it crashes on loading levels way too often, the research can be a bit expensive, if the devs can fix the stability issues I would probably up this to 4 star
Buyer beware Game will NOT work and there will be no resolution offered from the company. Refund would be great since game will not work.
Very slow app.  Does not worth a penny. Very slow app.  Does not worth a penny.
What do the green and red dots mean on the bus tracker What do the green and red dots mean in the bus routes why is there no option telling you what these things mean in the app
Upgraded from note 3 to note 4. Now it does not work. Normally no big deal if app sucks delete but paid for this one
Gameplay is boring. Gets old quick.
Buggy on S6 Using on a galaxy s6 and buttons are unresponsive, location doesn't seem to be great and no social media updates Give me the gromits paper map any day
No easy buttons for this paid app. But have to use it if you need to watch sling on android. They should have give this app free with device. Lot of improvements can be done to improve UI.
Doesn't work at all it sucks
Ads Fair enough having a game with ads. Though far to many early on, I couldn't play the first level and enjoy the game.
Xign HackDetect Idk why that Xign HackDetect always appears every time I open the app.. even if I've already uninstall the game killer app.. what should I do
Noooo I saved more than 15 drawings but only two are left... I pressed save to gallery for all and saw the notification saying saved to gallery. I was hoping to have them for special plans.

They copied the title from polar bit. This game sucks, there's no upgradability, there are huge stupid 18 wheelers, it's not smooth, and Reckless Racing2 by Polarbit not Pixelbit is far better and cheaper.
Very upset, DON'T BUY I am very upset, I purchased the widget and it will not work, The app works but the widget DOES NOT work, Would love to have used it, Disappointed 
Please fix.  Crashing constantly. Why have I paid over 45 for different instances of this App for you to make it free
Well designed but poorly implemented This now after months of use keeps on quiting with the message the android market cannot verify the license of this application. Contacted the developer, no support, no workarounds so far. Unusable.
Didn't work.. Didn't even have a option for visio tvs. And none of the Samsung options worked either for my other TV. They are new nice TVs and my phone is a galaxy so I thought it would work.
AI easy to beat, online never stay that long AI is pretty terrible no opponent feedback or penalty for dropping means people leave games whenever they are losing.
Time waste ..  worst game I have ever seen...
NOT FREE Why pay for such a simple app Basic info, no special features. All the stats it return has to be entered first. iphone users get it free. You can do it yourself on excel. Only real feature is to enter your score.
Can't even add shoes to my collection on my Note Edge
Can't play I see it's nice game but can't open after open popup say  Error3318 illicit activity detected
Bad purchase Program won't load it keeps crashing
Huge battery drain Seems to have a bug which keeps the mobile radio active after a test for up to an hour. This massively drains the battery. Avoid until fixed
Doesn't count the games probably and keep disconnecting
Not good horrible
It is crap
Omg I got out on the first try like I thought it would be impossible but it wasn't I got out too easy sheesh waste of time downloading just think of the worst thing and read the description
From Number 1 to worst game Was the best game I've ever played  until the last update which made building units 10 times longer. NOT PLAYABLE anymore, SCREW YOU GREEDY DEVELOPERS.
Acorns acorns acorns Very hard to get acorn  and the las update sucks. I cannot claim my prize on the 24 hr challenge 
Ek dam bekar.does  not work.make fool
Framerate Incredibly slow and unplayable on newer devices. Especially on my G4. Please fix

Rubbish Doesn't work at all...uninstalled and tried again...no cigar.
Not good I have booked my first meru on yesterday night 2 hrs before. But the gab got cancelled on my arrival time without any intimation.MY FIRST MERU WENT WORST EXPERIENCE.
TO MANY THINGS THAT YOU HAVE TO BUY I HATE THIS IT IS STUPID YOU HAVE TO BUY MOST OF THE THINGS ITS STUPID NOT WROTH MY TIME SO UNINNESTALING
I love this game, but... The app no longer loads on my nook
Worst app ever came across Who says this product works only works with the creators phone and you dumb idiot you think it'll work with all the TVs. It was a complete waste of time installing this app and wasting my time to work on my tv
Too many screens The user interface just got way worse. In order to start a game it is necessary to navigate five screens Every time
Not impressed Looks like the new app is a downgrade from the earlier version,more features yes but the darn thing barely works  when it does it keeps freezing
Not working I've seen the videos looks fun but won't open and when it does it freezes 2 minutes into the game I want a refund please
I paid for this game I cant even play it, it crashes after the logo, why is that I got a refund and bought bloons 5 and the same thing happened, galaxy s5.
Good game. Well made. Ruined by the accountants. Levels are so easy they're boring,  unless you pay, and the ads are far from subtle.
On HTC desire 510 brought the premium version and then I play from phone to tv over WiFi an still shuts down want a refund or fix the problem have the TCL roku smart tv  it's suppose to be compatible for that 1 star playing from show box app
Bad Soo when you make a number and then pick the last one and then hit1 2 or 3 and you hit the green one but you can't hear any body
Ads in a baby game Games that put clickable ads in the play area should be required to tell you that before download, completely useless for my 2yo...
Language exclusiveness Why isn't there any option to chance the language or something like that
Nothing free here This app is a sign up for an internetbased subscription service. Can't even play 1 game without signing up for a free trial of 30 days access.
This game is not fun if you do the same people everyday. Also how about letting us turn the customers around so we can do the back. It will make this game a lot fun.
Still opens on lock screensecurity risk Running dodol locker on Samsung note 4 and I've made sure the toggle for open on lock screen is off in omniswipebut it still opens on the lock screen Huge security problem that needs to be fixed
Fun game Good game but need more builders and figure out how to attack other players seems impossible to take a islands better off raiding small villages....

Greedy So let me get this straight. I BUY an app but I still have to pay to get the rest of the app That's bulls Don't bother buying this game. It's the exact same thing as wheres my water just different characters.
Not an android app This app may work on iPhones but not on droid. It won't send via text or email. Wasted money.
Google friend This is a very worst game.......There is no option for setting the game in tilt mode . Don't download yaaaaaaaar.
Disappointed This game was supposed to be the next after one of the best games I've played on my phone, but the second game just isn't any good, because it doesn't load.
Not worth the time. Matches take too long. And the cards are not all that good.. Could have done better but, hey what do you expect from Blizzard.
Can't download Whenever I tap the save image button it will loading but then it says download failed . almost 10000 time I tried but it doesnt work . I already uninstall and install back but nothing happened 
Not a big fan of all the force stops Game was fun the 10 minutes it worked. .and the constant crashes are a pain.

Wasted My Data The physics of the game sickens me.
English The spelling, grammar,  and overall use of the English language was very poor. Also some questions aren't complete.
Ripoff Biggest ripoff of the series, u only get 3 episode of 20 stages, then everything else is in app purchase. Unless u planning to spend more money dont even bother.
Doesn't work The app doesn't say any words like it says it should. The flash cards do not say the words like it should. A complete waste. I can't figure out why it won't work
Wtf I play this on my phone with no problems but when I play on my tablet there's black blocks on everything I know its not my tablet because I just got it and it has no problem with running any other app
Disappointing Does not work on galaxy note at all. Can not do anything. No response

Well done to ruin a great apps This new version not working properly.  No stream update for my team Arsenal in the last couple days. It was once a great apps....
Not fair been playing for ages Try to start New gen and it tells me it's full and to continue it would delete the 1st gen. Click ok, it does nothing, not starting over so it's going
Broke after update It stop streaming online videos after update and everything else is super slow and takes a long time to stream.
it was the worst game I had ever played
Adverts I understand a free game will have adverts but to slap up an advert every two to three levels is stupid. Even brought an advert up while I was typing.
UPDATE Love this but it gets boring when you have only the small amount of options to build with. Please add more so we can get more creative and possibly add people  animals etc. Thanks
Worst game, not lunch in android mob
Fun board game, app is primitive  costly. Are you kidding I can't even save a game and come back to it later For an app that costs this much I expect to be able to do something as simple as save a game in progress.
No longer works since lollipop 5.02 update and it no longer works.
To much advertising Not a kid game
Awesome app It used to be fun until I got to the blitz bonus round...it can't find players so it makes play against the computer which are totally unfair cause they are almost unbeatable Unfair and took all the fun out

Shit Plain and simple, app doesn't show progress when linking to a tracker. App crashes every time I try to view my trips. Not getting any feedback from Discovery.
Most of the quizzes seem several years old. What's worse is the long quizzes make the app crash without saving any of my progress. When this happens I have to force the app to close and open it again.

Uninstalls itself on Galaxy S3 with Gear Incredibly annoying. I purchased the app and it installs and then gives me a warning about Samsung Gear on S6 and Uninstalls itself. Can't use it.
Not Good I hate the A.I. tooks so very long think, and when it's my turn to move I just in run out of time
Time consuming I don't like that you can't come back to finish.
Consistently crashing 9 out of 10 times when you open it it will crash. From what I can figure out, even after downloading an episode it still requires data use. Several bugs need to be fixed for this app.

Sweet baby girl. Clean up Why do you only let me have 1 room
Player are just too slow Slow players have ruined the game it takes almost 90 secs every turn that makes games almost 20 min. I wish they'd had a fast mode I'd pay for that but the game is ruined completely by people not being attentive
Wow This is the most horrible dumbest game ever im so sorry but its horr ible REALLY TERRIBLE DONT DOWNLOAD
Downloaded this app a few months ago and couldn't get past the loading screen got a refund than decided to give it another shot now it says there's an error downloading and now  the refund button is nowhere to be found
very bad support i have sent many emails for support and no reply i decided bye bye bad nimbuzz
Read this first. I purchased this paid app only because of shake to record. But it dose not work. I even twice emailed the developer but no response I am terribly upset. Please  Don't go for the paid app. It just waste of money. 
Error.... error.... error.... error.... error Error.  Error. Error. Error. Error. Error. Error. Error. Error. Updated. Error. Error. Error. Error. Error. Error. Error. Error. Error. Error. Error. Error. Error. Error.

Fart noise Great game as long as you don't want to play it... If you just like to look at icon and occasionally open only to have it crash then I would recommend this game
Saved game disappeared Had all my progress saved. Then out of no where it restarted. So disappointed. Not worth th e time any more
Worst ever if you are in a good mood and feel happy, then download this game and play I'm quite sure immediately you will feel headache, and then app developers ki M, B ek kar denge.
Hate it Had to delete stuff just to download after that I ended up not downloading it and downloaded everything else back instead
There should be an option to choose the sound for push notifications.Search option is missing as well
It sucks.booooo The game is so laggy and I cannot even see stuff also there all too many ads and errors it keeps crashing
Not accurate. Not just wrong location but wrong town.
Bonus Took all my bonus credits I was still in the bonus and was over 7000 credits and it gave me 2 bonuses in the bonus round on the 2nd free bonus is when it took all my credits.  What bs.
Just installed the app......it seems to be fighting my tablet for orientation.  Played with it and locked kind of got it to work but, then it cut off a portion of the screen that is necessary.
Needs improvement... Just downloaded it and has a lot of features and design PROS the problem is that I don't receive any push notifications even when I configure the app for it. Also can't RT or fav, sends an error popup message. FIX IT
Ad likers can download. Kid game. And also each stage you must watch an ad video. So disgusting.
Cant open. After I downloaded the data, it suddenly says that there is an illegal program. I'm sure that I dont have any illegal program, can you fix this

GPS doesn't work. Phone gets very hot when using this app and GPS rarely works at all. If it does work location is wrong. Not worth paying for. Would be a fantastic app if it worked right.

S5 mini no funciona No funciona
This is very nice My daughter like it
Way too many ads, annoying pop ups. Really irritating that it asks you to rats after every other puzzle. Puzzles are a bit too easy and reuse a lot of the same wordsclues.  Keyboard is too small.
not able to intall this game after i deleted it please fix this not able to intall it
Ok, limited functionality
The worst sat navigation application Better buying a standalone sat nav than this application.  Every response from the development team is exactly the same message must be a generic message
It would be helpful if the keyboard didn't flit around. Don't this is it.

Not that good. This doesn't even get me 5 likes and im really concerned about this. Y'all should really fix this.
Spelling, wrong answers, repeated questions etc. This app has horrible grammer which confuzes the living shit out of you. It has spelling mistakes wrong answers, missing signs and repeats the same 30 questions. It needs to be fixed immediatly
Money pit. This game like others start good and then when things are added its all about the Dev's making money.  U get Rip off on so many things in here for over price items. Lower the item prices make spending real money worth it dam it.
Babies I thought it was going to halfway teach me how to play piano but it did not. Its not the worst though
Good game but annoying ads The game is good but I keep getting frustrated at the amount of ads that keep appearing. Is there any way to purchase the game to remove the ads Quite happy to pay for a game that I enjoy playing without the annoying ads.
I paid RM3.50 by RHB Bank card to Google EA today, but the bank told me Google EA to deduct RM7.50 from my acount, why i hav to pay double money  How can i get back my money  Is it Google EA cheating money

WE HAVE TO SEE ANWER FOR EVERY QUESTION Boooooring game every time I have to see anwers not free the maker of this game has lost his brain mad fellow..we can see anwers on youtube hehehehehehe.......
It's essentially just a scam where you win nothing, and they ask you to spend money for online slots
Crashes on my Moto 360 5.0.2 Loved the app and watch faces but the app simply crashes and never loads on my Moto 360 which is Uptodate and working great with every other thing Terribly upset with this buy...
How do I sign out I would give the app 5 stars if I could sign out No option to sign out after signing in.
I Lv it so much wish u can HV more
ver
Needs some serious work. Buggy and prone to crashes. Thanks to this app, I have been able to listen to a portion of many wonderful stories. Navigation is a mystery. Not very intuitive.
This is the waist game  I never seen
Feedback and lags The mic idea for the phone is great but with the feedback and lagging of voice recognition makes the game unplayable
Not respo d ALWAYS NOT RESPONDING WHEN I LINK TO MP3
Unbelievable Scam It won't work unless you upgrade to the 1.99 version FOR REAL

Problems
This app does not keep the interest of a smart toddler and they can easily back out of it.
Money seeking As soon as I downloaded the app I was told that the trial period was over and I have to purchase it
Not worth the money. This game felt like a beta, of a demo. I was expecting some kind of open world evolution type game... It's just another wannabe flappybird. If it was free I'd give it 3 stars.
The update messed with the app, because I can only open it and within a matter of seconds it closes itself. I have tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it but then it only lets me sign in and continues doing it again.
fix it It wont post what I wrote about the pictures nor will it let me comment on my own pics wtf
Error Just coming up with 'error' at top of screen... annoying Used to work well Haven't been able to see anything in 3 weeks

It sucks It's one of the worst games in my life .Don't download this f.....king games .
Cute Game But... Would appreciate it if there could be some sort of hints to help through the levels that are quite hard to play. That is the only reason why I gave it 2 stars
Would rate 5 but the jersey are the same for every 1 please fix it
Game is craps. Download but won't even launch. Waste of time.
OMG Advertising Ruins Game Great game, but advertising appears after almost every level. It's unbelievable
I'm sad I am a backer for the main game and have bought every game of yours but honestly this makes me mad. Laggy, buggy, lose a face off and it's a goal on me. Ridiculous. Please fix it
Pro won't work without data turned on Beware that if you're stuck in some place without data, Pro won't work because it can't check your license first so you are screwed.
Lost my points. Love yo play this game. I had more than 200,000 points and when I opened the game after few days, I left with only 50,000 points.
I couldent even sign in
Does not work on samsung note
Not what I expected I want to be able to put more than 1 character in my texts.
Very displeased there is no area even close to me, that's something you should advertise, most weather radios use s.a.m.e. codes and work EVERYWHERE, refund please
Doesn't work Was working, my Samsung note 4 did an update and since then won't work, my child loved it til that
Doesn't work I installed this app and ended up with a permanent message on my home screen saying orientation sensor not found
Fun for a bit.... Gets very boring and repetitive after a while. Please add better vehicle customization and multiplayer. Also delivery missions was a great thing that was taken away
Stupid App. Pwd works on Website but not doesnt work on APP. Thats the reason you ppl gave Rs 150 discount is it on App
I have waited so long for this day I loved this game on the iPad but on Android it's too slow or lagging... Slow response doing turns and everything...plz fix it and I will gladly make it 5 stars
Hate it U need to upgrade that game only thing to do is push songs
Doesn't upload my photos It just says upload successfully but nothing is uploaded...useless app
Doesn't work As soon as I downloaded it it would not do anything but say something went wrong.
Sucks, controls suck,
Doesn't work with atleast 3 phones on 3 different computers I've tried.  Would not recommend unless miraculously yours works.  Have tried support channels, with no success.
Not my type Please unlock all of them then I will give  you a 5 thank you
Unreliable 5 bucks for this. Don't buy.   I would say 75 of the time that the video skips and you miss like half of your swing on playback.  No way to make it stop.  Avoid this app.
Who make this bad games Is people that retarded
Worst app ever Paid .99 cents I know but won't even open on my phone.   How do I get my money back you scheisters.
Poor game, got right in to it till I realised that u can't do most off stuff, my god the ones I played on around 6 years ago are better  Don' t buy not worth itPoor  Game
Apps sucks This app is worse than tabncrap2. Does not support any forums I subscribe to. We should get a refund no matter how lon we have had it.
Very good horseshit Advertising hot girls while your little one is enjoying the games and learning you will have your time to check hot chicks as well. That's low very low
Not the best,  but still good I only get one chapter...  Go away, maybe make it add supported, for free users, please
Always random  meaningless Total crap....use EchoVox instead

Substandard Chutia bnao ap hona chahiye iska nam
Worst experience They say paytm 50 off and ask for cash at the end. Never going to ride. Customer Care is too bad.. Uber and Ola is better wrongly I selected this cab. I regard now.
Please help Liked the game for my son but the bought full version and nothing changed Why
Didn't work Downloaded twice but wasn't there
James Beresford Worked great till all expired then cost jump from 0.83p up to either 4158 pound . I'd be cheaper buying a sat nav .
Won't let you passed level 3 unless you want to use coins...going to uninstall not fun......
Matches output is a crap as its not filtering based on the preferences set on my profile...
Does not work On my S5 will not save a video or import a video. App needs a lot of work.
Crappy bonus The bonus wheel is a joke. The rewards program is a waste of time. I can't play enough to even get the next level. You should invest more time making the bonus features fun and rewarding.
Loving it at first... After level 17, I'm having problem playing this game. It keep shutting down and I'm frustrated as I love this game so much. Need to uninstall it now.
I sucks YOU CANT HEAR ANYTHING AND I HANGS UP IN PEOPLE FACE PLUS YOUR CALLS DOESN'T COME THROUGH 
Can't log in. Useless
Nothing new in it Y u ppl start insisting every1 to update Ur apps when nothing new in it....
Will not unfreeze my daughter Cry's every time' and she loved this game
Keep having to uninstall and reinstall after last update. App won't load after yellow screen. Very annoying. Enjoyed this game. Also, since the last install my phone is acting buggy.
Nothing to write home about Payouts not high enough based on amount you bet
Not sensing West of time
Having problems with this app on nexus4 Purchased app but still says app is unlicenced everyone the app is started. App crashes when trying to turn off music
STUPID  AND  THE  WORST GAME  OF ALL TIME SO SHUT UP PEOPLE  WHO  SAY IT'S  GOOD

I didn't like how u had to pay for the stores with real money how come we couldn't have payed it with the play money on the game...just lame...I hate it
Gamepads not supported I can't play this game on my tv where I have no touch input.
Slow Supppppper supper slow on note III ... nice game though , will rate 5 if the performance has improved
Cool This game wasn't like I expected it to be like you can't d almost any thing because it is all locked up so how do people play a game that there is stuff you need to buy l just don't get it it is no fun when people do that
Lol Worst escape game I've ever played. I never even write reviews but after ten minutes of nothing I want t o punch the creator.
Random Crash I used to love this app, very reliable, would do what I wanted. But now, it keeps crashing, and I'm lucky to have it open for more than 15 seconds.
You can't save it
Love Love god
Looks nice but is wrong a lot A good example was yesterday. It said zero chance of precipitation. Had a large storm front come through at 1000 am followed by another at 600 pm that included a tornado watch. Uninstalled.
Poor graphics It's very very slow BAD GAME
Great game, update ruined it I cant rank up players anymore. Ive tried and failed to rank up 3 different players at least 10 times with no success. What happened
Ok... Its an ok game...i paid for the upgrade because it said I would be able to play live with other ppl HOWEVER that was a lie.  U cannot Dont pay for upgrade
Crap Not worth 6.00. My son hated it.
Not worth it Downloaded and it kept crashing when I tried to play.  Never made it past initial screen.  Don't waste your time or data.
Ever since the last update, I was unable to get through even a single game without the crashing midway. Quite a shame since I've been playing this game for well over a year. I would be happy to change to 5 if the developer does something about it.
It doesn't load pgn files or have the opening book, for 8 dollars
Was fun, but Takes too long to play. Now no more mpoints. Think I'll pass.
I just rated 5 stars You took all of my credits again. And so I rate 2 stars
Really a grind. I've played a lot of tower defense games, but this one is more work than fun.  The developers made it just hard enough to motivate you to purchase inapp upgrades.  Uninstalling.
When I get a few wrong it say fail in a mean way
Connection So My little sister was playing on my iPhone 5 and she said it would not even let her play She hated it
Not istalling Purchased full version and when installing getting error package file has bad manifest
More Can you make all things free and we have already paid for this game if you con make it free my rating will go back to 5 stars.
Issue, please solve No even a single picture is loading  It's not showing not my profile pic even.... Please fix this..
Won't open Please help, used it for a day and now it won't open. For a paid app it shouldn't really have that kinda fault
Please remove ads
Now it freezes when the adds start.Fix it.
Just like the others This is just like all the other coin dozer game. Not much to work towards and keep you wanting to play.
Well its ok All u do is drag a train on lines of press Dots
Won't open Successfully paid for and downloaded. But game refuses to open. Wouldn't care if I didn't pay money for it.
Not working This app won't even open. Have attempted to install uninstall and install again ri no avail. Very disappointed
Giga Gargantuar I love this game and everything BUT like what everyone said, giga gargantuars can't be killed.
Thats just not good No laser light out of the phone and just making us fool
Good
Unfortunately, Juice Jam has stopped Keep having this problem on my Galaxy Tab and Note 4. Deleted data 3 times on the tab but still happens.
Why it is not starting the game when i click on any mode after that its loads  the game is quit please fix this problem i may give it five stars
Boo 1. Way to many adds 2.boring 3. It makes you do the same the same things over and over again 4.need I go on 
It is a fashion game. I love fashion games but not this ome It tells you where you are going to go so I pick the perfect outfit and they say really rude comments.  Every look that I do it says rude comments. I do not recommend this to anyone .
Does not work. Items collected disappear and even after cracking the first code nothing happens.  When Walk through opened it only contains adds for other games. Waste of time
Worst game Worst game i have ever played.. Studying is better option rather playing this game.
Can't load previous tweets Latest update broke the ability to load previous tweets, which essentially makes this app useless until it's fixed  it was working great previously
Keeps forcing closed Ever since the update it keeps forcing closed on me and wont let me play calling all agents
AWESOME  forget the 5 stars Every time I find a great game, I rate a 5 and loose all my coins. I won't be rating any more games.
Every time I get far my screen turn white, and I have to start all over This is getting really depressing
Poor update Game reloaded a beginning of game everytime . Now it won't even reinstall .sorry I paid so much for it.fun before last update  but now keeps resetting.  Please fix this glitch.
Can't even open I lobed this game, but now it just closes once I hit play. Hopefully it is fixed soon.
Worst dude..... For the first time also it need to purchase..Need to do some changes
Always interrupted You are interrupted every few games by ads trying to convince you to install other games. Very annoying. I uninstalled it and I don't recommend it.
Pathetic system gets hung with even complete WiFi and have lost good games
I HATE THIS First of all why do we HAVE to buy the full version I mean like why can't we just so the mulipcation So this should change T
UI is terrible Terrible looking app
Couldn't play Don't download this game, as soon as u open it an ad pops up then closes the app waist of time
Drive in a straight line Worse than 16 bit games from 20 years ago. And for the last time all you retarded garbage developers, NOS means Nitrous Oxide, a combustible gas, not NITROGEN which is present in our atmosphere and is an inert gas.
I can't read the 1st chapters I would click a manga I would want to read, but it won't let me read chapters 117, and its annoying. I'm thinking of undownloading it, but that kinda makes me sad cause, they have some good mangas.
No offline play I don't have WiFi. Everwhere I go, and to have to use online service every time I get on Lame. It sucks I have limited 4g use 
Rubbish,  boring.  Not very stimulating and couldn't exit
Aplikasinya sangat Belum bagus Komik sering gak muncul, crash,force close,lelet padahal pake wifi super cepet, iklan bejibun, komik jg bnyk yg gak bsa diakses jadi APLIKASI PHP
Very buggy The game could be fun if it didn't crash every few levels or when you try to even open the app. The report screen is upside down and it locks my phone up.
DLC unplayable Still can't play the DLC, I bought it months ago, but still can't play, it keeps asking to buy it again. The latest update won't fixed it.
Does not work My daughter's loved this game when they played it on my S4. Just downloaded on G4 and game crashes as soon as game starts. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling and still crashing. Will give better rating once problem is fixed.
Always Loading When I open it , it only says Loading and Our Wifi is very Fast ... Fix It
Notifications keep turning on. Got this installed on both tablet and mobile, but getting fed up of the notifications keep coming through even though I've turned them off repeatedly. Uninstalling on the mobile as I don't want it to keep going off 247.
Revisted Liked this along time ago. Short lived. 55 is just ridiculously hard. Good for a short replay but uninstalling again as tye fun just gets sucked away to abrutply
Dreams and nightmares It the best meek mill game my son played

Won't work I will change my rating if someone can tell me how to fix it or just want my money back.
Hari Ridhi  Chaniu Mani manav prysh
Fatal Errors...Arrrrgggghhhh It has happened three times now.  Had to reinstall and start over at beginning the first two times. No more...I'm done.
Keeps Crashing While I can stream, the app almost immediately gives me a force close window. Keeps playing while the window us up, but I can't do anything else with my phone.
Bullshit If aap can tell you about your baby then Bengali baba will have to retired D
Not so good It's very boring who made it I don't like it
fraud I had total of 105 coins when I logged out.... after few mins when I logged back it shows 60 coins..... don't cheat ... 1 star is equivalent to 0 star.....
Holy crap people fix this game so it stops freezing all the time. Awesome game but the constant freezing sucks. You would think they would have fixed it by now or maybe they just don't care.
I love that game but  this game is nice but fairy pack superhero pack is locked why screw you  dont download
Stopped working black screen just sound
Need always download Each time I play the video, I need to download them again. Any function to save the video The video files are big.
Don't download It's wouldnt let me download the game and it stole my money. Due to an error. I want a refund. Beware it won't even download
This app doesn't work
bad connection the multiplayer does not work for me.  it asks to turn on the wifi but it is enabled.  need help with this please.
Okay The game is good but I dont know if I can play this section without paying for this or that. Kind of to short.
Not worth my money Its super short
Well... Uninstalled. It started nice, for a few hours. Now it's less than a day later and I've gotten two of my notifications, luckily I've been near a computer a lot. I'd like a refund.
this app sucks I downloaded this game can't get into it. Know widget to bring game up. Dosent show in settings that I even downloaded it.can't . Uninstall either. Sucks
Freezes I'm very disappointed in this game I love playing the Sims,but ur freezes up within five minutes of me.playing Needs fixed and you guys are ignoring the issue it's not fair because we PAID for this game
Not a very user friendly interface Loads of room for improvements
Control is awful Especially with the random encounter, it becomes frustrating very quickly when you couldn't move right
Not working Absolutely none of the games are playing or even being recognized. I have unzipped them all and downloaded the BIOS app. I will rate higher if someone can assist me.
Vendy No bad I know why I give 2 star coz the cars no let you go in front even you get money on the road still same
Not reliable For three days it said my daughter was 45 miles north, when in fact she was home. It never did find her when she was 65 miles north, then when she gets home it did as I mentioned
before i liked it but now its shit ...while playing everytime adds come in between again and again and mobile got stuck and game will be closed ...
Stupid as hell The reason I don't like it's because I hate the stupid cars ,they crash in to me by there self.
The game has one massive issue being that it does not open. Keeps coming up with an error message and then closing down. Losing your progress everytime. Needs to be fixed
No updates for the last 9 months I'm not sure what good it will do giving the game away for free, when all the complaints are about it freezing up on everyone's devices Strange marketing strategy...
Pointless I see no reason why this couldn't be integrated into the SuperSport app...
Too many ads Way too many ads during gameplay. Every 30 secs I  am forced to watch the same 20 sec ad. Please fix this or it will lead to me uninstalling.
Game doesn't load the board I rated this game a 5 in the past because it was so much fun to have one of my most loved boardgames in mobile format. Now it no longer loads the board after selecting to play in any format. Disappointing
Bakwas game Worst game ever played
Please listen to costumers. I really like this game but I'm a little disappointed on why we have to wait so long to get tickets . Most of your costumers are also complaining about it to . If you want more stars from people can u satisfy us please
The matching game was not well executed. But the worst part is the ads that pop up in this game. I have a 3 year old playing, and the ads are wildly inappropriate.
Most ridiculous app ever Won't let me login and no link button instruction on how to upgrade.
Not working Love this on the laptop and ipad, but can't get past the intro screen on my phone. Would be 5 stars if it worked.
Not Need to be on the Internet to play, refund if u ask me,

Not an oval. If you're going to call it a rhombus instead of a diamond or kite, then you'd better not call an ellipse an oval.

So stupid don't  get it
Useless Another update That's one per week Are you having a laugh Complete bloatware mb eater Why don't you fix it and trim it once and for all. Friendcaster was so much better than this official app.
Dissatisfied Everything was great till I got to level 86 now the game won't load, keeps telling me i need internet access but I have no problem loading other games, what happen.
Too many bugs.  Often the puzzle and the answer don't match or it won't let u select the answer or letters that are correct
Not Kid Friendly... Until you can remove the menu bar, your kid will always touch out of the app.
Rip off How I look good with no pic up or how can I respond to any one if I haven't even sent them anything waste of time and can't delete account I'm flagging this
Not as good as thier lost city game Still reasonably fun but this was a bit short, some of the connections really didn't make as much sense to me  had to use hints much more than Lost City. Just not quite as interesting
Hate the game Booo this game is stupid and dumb people in the world must be hate this game
Cluttered and unintuitive Smart mode is a mess The whole UI looks like a total clusterfuck. It is very unintuitive that IDK where to find the books I just bought There was nothing wrong  with the old UI so IDK what prompted this HORRIBLE change
I cannot continue without buying the level with 400rs.so this game is waste. I can play only one level.waste app ever.don't install this game
Log in error. Can't log in with Facebook or create an account. Just an error message.
Ok but bad layout Is hard to play, it shoul be better if I was able to customize the size and position, also it seems there are some issues with fast combinations
Wow its off Geeze. It worked for a second. Thought I liked it, bought it, now it's so off I'm looking directly at the moon and this app is showing it to my left.  WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK.

No good Toddler can easily close out of the app. It doesn't lock
The IAP Killed This Game I'd rather buy a game that have it all, than a game that I have to pay for everything in order to get better experience..
Didn't keep the time Useless.    I installed it at 200 and it never changed from 200 . I deletes the widget and put it back up and same thing.
Samsung S5 Nice, but 3 different apps need to be downloaded to make it work Minimize it.
  
Waste app remove play store
Slow Only displays 1 frame every 3 seconds. I have 3 different makes of cameras at 3 different locations running very fast Internet at all ends, It runs like a .99 cent app if that but definitely not 3.99. 2 stars for the ease of use.
Neels Terblanche For such a prestigious event its a pretty poor app. Please go and learn from the Volvo ocean race. That is an app gents.
Very disappointed  Downloaded this game today because I love the others. It only gave me 12 levels. It asks if I want to download full version... Takes me to original Where's my Water.
  .     
Rubbish Makes no sense
Really Still needs some work to be as good as it was. Need to be able to see how many spins you have in a bonus, 1 star until that is readded.
Not working I know I didn't spend a fortune on this app, but it should work. It keeps saying there was an error retrieving meets. Please fix. Great info when it is working, but is frustrating since it rarely works.
Not bad but too expensive Nice but I think the premium features are a rip off,  I can get this stuff free from other similar apps

Doesn't open Costs money and it's rubbish.  Can't open it. It says there's no Internet connection. Please refund or fix it.
1 player is ok, but the questions are repetitive.  The option to play against others is terrible, I have had o ver 30 first turns and after a week not one person has responded. Shame,  it could of been a good game.
APP SUCKS At first I thought that it would use the camera to make your flash colored but no its fake
It does not even work I hate this game.
Way to fast, I was on easy, it shouldn't go that fast, was ridiculous and frustrating.
Hated it Worst app ever

Excellent Game, latest update causes it to stutter during gameplay like crazy Unpaid version works fine, smooth, like all the other AB series. But this version stutters during gameplay bad
They needed to make a 0 star for this game Only half of the instruments worked it wouldnt let me leave the screen and then it my tablet and messed up my setting. WORST GAME EVER DONT GET IT

Bakwas It is ol game and tooooo browwing
Simple but not fun Medium level is easily beatable. Hard level always ends in a draw. I guess AI and myself have it figured out.
Unable to get details for Mumbai  Maharashtra Plz add soon.
useless app won't come up on my phone at all won't give me accurate readings
Not free at all As soon as you open the app there is a big lock sign. Try and click anything and you will be asked to pay. Rubbish. Don't bother installing.
Maintenance I mean come on this is the longest maintenance on a game I ve ever seen to be honest it's pathetic to say the least especially after an update I hope they will be offering compensation for this total waste of time and money
Ok I would really love it if u could keep playing once a al goes bankrupt. U can be killing people but then a player with no money lands on another AL property and they win even though u have more monopolys..
Its BAD Every time I get a new level it goes back to the home screen and I'm so mad I wanted a fun game not a horrible game

Not Compatible With GALAXY S4 Not Compatible With GALAXY S4 and I paid for the app it's non refundable and I can't play it at all definitely not recommended for anybody to purchase

It freezes to much.
Not much attention paid on usability Need to improve usability, make it less tap app. Also improve on UI
This game... is not a game There is literally no game play to this app. All it is a choice of 5 very crude animations of someone being murdered.
Awsome people Ride a cool bike
Cycling news is better Can't get enough from the free version to tell if this is worth buying.  If I get up at three AM to watch the tour, I will watch it on TV, not my phone.

What Why is this game nothing like the advert put up on facebook It's not even similar, I didn't even play into much if you have to use another games footage to sell it, well it can't be that good.
Crashes a ton This game has great potential if it didn't always crash. I can't get through Wave 5 because of this. If this is fixed, it could be a 45 star game.
Waste.. I hv installed 3 times... it's just not starting...
Great game but glitchy now I've played this game for years and loved it,  but recent updates have caused it to repeatedly freeze up on me.  Over and over.  I've reinstalled it twice without any improvement.  I'm dumping it until it's fixed.  Sigh.
Diz game es nt even fit 4 1 star
Himym They got rid of the HIMYM category which was our favorite. That didn't need to happen and it really brought down the value of the entire app. Will probably delete soon.
Unsatisfied..  The game's crashing  It looks great, but when I click continue and when the phone guy starts talking it'll crash.  Hope you can fix it immediately ..
Boring as it is simple an the same situation.
What the... Can't log in...... I waited for half hour still it's showing that trying to log in...... Wow.
Very bad game if there where 0 stars I would prefer more to give that and the game is not having a menu I tried to shoot but I couldn't .this game is just silly rubbish

 , ,  , 
Not good Don't bother buying this app. It runs like shit on a quad core 2.5ghz phone. Slow as anything.  Avoid until it improves.
Truly Awful Constantly freezes or refuses to play the podcasts entirely. Its 2015, and you can't make an app that plays mp3s without messing up every time Use my 3 to make a better app or send your programmers to Devry. Get it together
Stops responding App stops responding constantly  By the time you get back into the game you've missed a batter or plays   Not worth the money
Blab
Can't play anymore Cannot find server it says, if it's fixed I'll update my review.
iCrash 2015 No idea how this game plays because it crashes immediately on launch and can't even start. Using a Sony Xperia C3 on Lollipop.
Feed is Too Dynamic Feed is too dynamic and will change or reset from one session to another making it difficult to find or go back to a post. App would be much better if the feed was static and could be manually updated.
Starts out fun Since the upgrades it's a lot more realistic. Though I lost my standings I had before. Overall it's not bad.
Poooorest  game I say that dont install it no view changing option i just hate this bloody piggy game
Bad game No science apply. Wrost game ever

Great game, missing key features No immersive mode and it doesn't sync across my devices with Google login Come on these features should have been available 2 years ago

It wont download Hi I have a issue on sponge on the run and it won't download. Please fix this then I'll rate it 4 or 5 stars, thank you.
No level up It just 1 level no fun no challenge. Make tab unlimited
Please fix bugs Unable to set minutes by typing them in. Sound is way to quiet needs to be adjustable.
Get closer to the sound. Had my television cranked so high the neighbours a couple of streets over could probably hear it. Why not just say you can't identify it. Crap
Disappointed I thought it would be better. I will be on the web version more. I will only play this one when on the road
Good when it works Bought this for a trip to Ghana to avoid roaming charges and now the licence has expired. Aside from this, and a few crashes, a reasonable app.
Since latest update I am unable to view log results, and leaderboard... Fix please
Using GPS when app closed For some reason the app has been firing up GPS even when closed and knocking battery life. Might have to delete as phone not getting through the day. Previously 4 stars.
Stops at map 210 cannot go on any further. Dnt download
Fix Game crashes way too much, on Galaxy S5 but also iPhone. The game is fun, but crashes occur way too much Fix it or I'll be uninstalling.

Ditched me again On top of it I get push notifications that a cab is available 15 times in 5 minutes while the 1 scheduled a day earlier is in cool to say he is busy
4.4 After your last update and 4.4 update Plume has literally fell apart. Can't get it to refresh, will not scroll and will not mark things as read.  Please fix
Costs 35 to join I bought the app but they did not disclose that in order to USE the app you have to register on the website first which costs 35 minimum.
Sucks  dck Booo just like temple run
Please mention age group and big icons for higher levels
Terrible game Each time i passed it the guy kept throwing the ball out if bonds do not install this game
Not for adults. This app is pretty cool except for the fact that it's nothing but a bunch of kids. Hardly any adults. If you're ten years old this app is for you.
Update I really love the game but hate the new updates. Now I can no longer see a profile picture and it's not longer a score or a Facebook connect
It sucks It crash alot I was just into a free Tournament and I won 4 bingos then it crashed I lost my first round...I'm about unstalled it...
Why the loading is so loooooonnngggg I wait about 20 minutes just to play at one place.. that ridiculous man Is it bug Fix it man... coz i'm using money here
Trending apps near you This was a great app until this annoying adware arrived. There's no way to get rid of it even if you X it out.  Ridiculous
Crashed The app keeps crashing as it opens. Moto G Xt1033 lollipop.
A waste of timespace
Adds after every move. Game is about recognizing numbers. To answer the child has to be able to read the words. This isn't maths  it's a reading challenge. Getting uninstalled now.
i love the game but giving it one star cause it keeps bugging me to rate it if u have faith in ur app u dont need to keep begging me to rate it ill rate it on my own if its good enough
Wouldnt install on nook hd Had to download an apk to be able to play a game I had bought, was very easy. Will probably just go ahead and do that next time... Good game, like
Not gud app. Can't open
Love the app before but when i updated it is constantly saying it has crashed.
This app was the best,but this new version crushes several times.
Not working After a week and a half of not fixing the problem or responding to emails. I assume you will not be fixing. Say goodbye to a paying customer.
Optimized Really Sure, it runs but it looks horrifyingly bad. Blurry and over stretched.
I hate it I hate it because people are always crashing into me an well because im alwayz crashing into things. Needs to be improved. Also do not install
Wont allow me to log in It tells me to log in so i do. Then tells me the email address or password isnt correct or not registered. But i can log in with the same details on the computer or the web browser...
No responding its says. Blocklaucher has crash I will give 5stars if its fiexeds
Having trouble Used to give it five stars.....Having a lot of loading issues. Please fix so i can enjoy it again.
Doesn't Download Game Data Stupid game, doesn't even DL it's own data It says get a good wifi connection, hello I was 3 feet away from my router Waste of time.
Bekar No better comments
Nothing loads None of my son's meet times are loading. I will keep trying but so far not impressed On a Samsung galaxy note 4 lollipop
I paid for it but cant downlaod now
Nice work keep it up
Worst....waste of time. Very cheap. Not good for quality liking people. Bad graphics. Improve tilting sensitivity. Waste of time. Don't download. I wouldnt even give it a star.
Won't load Try making an app that fing loads that would be great
Please enable landscape view Please allow landscape mode for phones and tablets. You are forcing us to change our viewing orientation, when it should be the other way around. Your app should change display based on our viewing orientation.
Inoperable with Smartwatch After trying on my own and the help page the app failed to connect with my Samsung Galaxy gear watch.  And email sent for help about 3 to 4 weeks ago still unanswered and unresolved. Waste of money.
Lags and glitches It's very hard to play when it lags alot. Waste of time
Useless cannot sync Cannoot synchronize.  I will put this to 5 when corrected with new version which STILL ISNT OUT.  Purchased new version and now cannot sync.
C R A P Most of the widgets you see in the picture need to be payed, only a few shiitty widgets are free
Um I love your guyses apps but the new update is weired it let me touch the shoe for a more detailed look and it keeps stoping
Useless Will not install on my Galaxy Note 2. Followed advised by developer, still will not install. Will be requesting refund pls.
Extremely buggy Uninstalled within first 20 seconds. Horrible lag, graphics turned to grey in patches.
Wtf I can't read any manga only one page is on the app and I can't read it till October plz fix this
o because you can,t pick the song
Would be better if you don't have keep getting more Stars to go to the next level Would be better if you don't have to get more stars to be able to play the next board
bad graphics and control
An ad after every game Even for a cheap app only a buck, having to close a popup ad after every single game is going to wear very thin very, very quickly.
fuck rest in peace bullshit
Clock keeps freezing up
Madden moble If you ever take the moment to work out all the bugs this would turn out to be an awesome game to play. You may want to consider stop crumb snatching. And give up a little more money make the game more interesting thank you
Make adventure mode work Make adventure mode work and single payer work it just crashes if you fix that ill rate 5
Loads slow Very slow loading. Run in background.Permissions Ads Please put The stand, hit,  surrender buttons more to the left in the center. Notification alerts only works sometimes for bonus.
The ads took over my screen after so long. Disappointed because I was enjoying it.
Game us cute, BUT, touch function freezes up. Most if the time it freezes and the touch function doesn't work.   I am playing it on a new tablet, this shouldn't happen.  Please fix this problem, then I'll change my rating.  This is fustrating
This last update was horrible. Can not access half the game repeatedly kicked out of game. This needs to be fixed. Very disappointed right now.
It does not protect your apps as it says on the box If you clear your RAM on the phone the protection prompt for password disappear till you restart protect again.
Not free None of the levels were unlocked. The game is free to download,  but you apparently have to pay to get to any of the content. The description is misleading,  and that is being charitable.
STOP TRYING TO BOMBARD MY FACEBOOK Game is fun but it continually attempted to post to Facebook and to my friends after I said no. Uninstalled
           .  play market,     .
Its not letting me tilt At first of the game it lets u the instuctions, then it tells u to tilt i cant it just keeps running straight Fix it PLEASE If u dont u guys are 
Waste of time It's amazing how many times the dealer gets a 5 card 21. The dealer will have a 1921 90 of the time. Very predictable way to get you to spend money. Alot of ads too.
Bosan. gila bosan.
Don't waste your money App keeps crashing or disconnecting.  And nobody seems to be fixing the problem
I'm sick of re installing Soaks up all my data for nothing...settler scum
Sad  App lock is not working when I open my app first time app lock appears but when I do back n reopen my apps it doesn't works
Found a bug I know how to get perfect score almost every time without altering the app
Boring
Limited info. More info available when connected on internet. Can be a good app but need to give more info
New update Installed updates will not let me log on as soon as you read this you're going to put it down as an older version cuz your game is no good going to uninstall
Used to be good Using on my galaxy s6 the app crashes when the flash is used. The touch to focus is unresponsive unless you tap really lightly. Had no issues on my LG G2
Governor of poker I still don't have all of my stuff   I had to restart it. 
Hebrew to English is very bad Idiotic to translate street names and people's names.  The translations come out as gobbledygook   0.K.  for one word translation but otherwise needs to be upgraded to make sense.
Its a piece of crap It doesnt even work  Don't waste your data on this crap
Babu Better
Stuck on loading screen Beautiful game. I am glad I bought it. However, it freezes on the loading screen before level 3. Please fix this. I would really like to play this game. I would even buy the new chapter of it gets fixed.
Disappointed The AIs do not play nil hands the same way a human  does which results in a lot of nils not being made.
Venkat venkai V s

Fun game but it crashes constantly

Samantha This is the worst game I have ever played before. The game is not the same as in the picture. The laser doesn't even point out of my phone. I would suggest that you not get this app but its your choose
I wrote my review and you erased it. Why do the cards I discard and not picked up show up  way before the deck has finished And it's funny how when I discard a number I am waiting and all the sudden it's discarded by computer. I'm not stupid
T
Pro version is a joke Don't pay for it... Paid for pro version to get sound, microphone, and motion features. Does NOT work Waste of money

Nice but very slow and unresponsive Need optimization of game,  it will hang,  freezes after loading,  loading also take more time .  Even on WiFi it will load slowly..  And many times unresponsive to touch.
Stopped working after I login Worked fine before I login to get best times. After I login , it started to show error retrieving meets so I lost the purpose install it at first place.
More of an inconvenience I used to use this on my galaxy s3 and it worked perfect. Now on my note 4 it doesnt load the cinema layout. Kinda pointleas having an app thats making your life more inconvenient Fix please
Dont update After update it says unfortunately app stopped. Waste of money. I want previous version back.
Not working.. Every time I open the app it moves very slow and most of the time freezes. Please fix this Did I mention I paid for this 
Good Game, Terrible Notifications Game generates notifications if you don't play it daily. No option to turn this off in the app itself.
Worst game ever It keeps stoping whenever im in the middlle of a game so I've never actually finished a game 
I like it on pc it looks much better I want my money back I thought it would look the same as in the pc version it even doesn't deserve it's price...
Won't download 5 times waited and tried again..droid turbo 4k screen has to be able to play it....
You can't select mph,uninstaling
Laggy and slow down I have been having a lot of slow down on this, but it use to run perfectly.
Lip sync stopped working This app was great at first,  but after a recent update the lip sync stopped working and all videos have sound issues.  I love this app when is working,  but sadly I had to delete.
Ad's See many ads more than game. I hated
Worse than useless Can't use it due to feedback and microphone over sensitivity. Sony should refund ingame purchases until we can actually use the microphones.
Crashed as I was opening it Uninstalled immediately
Dawo Saadi saaxiib Waagaranay xaaladaas

Hate Cost to much money for activitie i would give it 5starts if it didn't cost to much money
Wish I could give less than one star Would give it a higher rating and buy it if they fix notifications. Tried the suggestion in FAQ but no good. They don't even reply when you raise issues.
SUCKS Server is unable, even if I can load the game I can't play it at all, I see many others are facing the same issue as well, Gamloft I hope you are reading this
Really Super buggy like i cant open the crafting area at all and i cant select the first three slots without trying to put a hole in my phone so i hope they fix it because it use to be fun

My Titanium Backup has stopped working correctly.   It's saying I only have 4 apps installed on the whole phone.  It's not showing anything beyond that.   I can't back up my apps because they don't show up.   Not system apps not user apps.   Ughhhh.
Make this game free all the mini game free and I will give you 5 stars

 I do agree with some of the complaints. Which would be no auto play, and if i want to up my bet i have to go back to the main homescreen. If u played the other Keno apps. this one is really good, but overall 2 stars, cause it could still be better.
Rip off Won't open, installed and reinstalled several times. Bought as a surprise for young American girl fan, glad she did't see it ... won't buy another American Girl game.

Latley I can't collect either breakfast or dinner coins if you go to the comments there is a bunch of people with the same problem also harder to get big payouts
Doesn't work... ...Most of the time.  Using the app on my kids new Samsung Tab 3 Kids edition.   Its freezes a lot, sometimes when opening app the screen goes black, and other malfunctions.  My kids love this game...When it does work.
NOT actual books was not impressed on cheesy sing a longs. Dancing animations are great for infanttoddler stages. Other than that  bad example of childhood favourites.
Very limited The free version does not allow you to select the ECU in the car. Cars have multiple ecu. Without the ability to select them you can't see all the error codes.

Ugly game
Can't install I cant install the full game after buying it. Waste of money. Im demanding a refund.

Wifi Needed for Extras I had this game on the ipad and loved it.   Works fine but if you purchase the very expensive expansion packs they will not work without wifi.   I don't have wifi available where I'm at so it's been a waste of money.
Values doesn't stick after reboot Set CPU frequency doesn't stick and revert to maximum after some period on nexus 5.  This used to work on older devices.  Might be limitation on 4.4  Don't think they're updating this app anymore.

It doesn't work if your ps4 is connected via ethernet. Maybe that should be fixed because you get a hell of a lot better connection that way. I shouldn't have to connect it to wifi to make one game work.

Not at all what I expected The pictures had nothing to do with the game, and all you could do really was add colors. Everything on there is locked almost. I would not suggest in installing it.
Freezes up You are billionaires and can't even build a decent app. I can't watch 30 seconds of it without it freezing up. I guess all the brains have gotten beat out of your heads over the years. Fix this if you're capable.

This app sucks Even after buying the full version ads still pop up and i have to come to the app store to open the full version. Its a complete waste of money
Video is always upside down No matter what I choose, the video is recorded upside down. I shouldn't even have to choose anything. The phone knows which way is up. Until this is fixed, this is a useless app.

Premium feature dont work After update to 5.0 android my premium status doesn't show up. 
Can't adjust incorrect time After a recent update, this widget now displays daylight savings time so is now an hour ahead and cannot be adjusted. This has left me with no choice but to buy a new widget.

Game locks and crashes frequently I would give it 5 stars, but it freezes and crashes often. I assume it is a device brand specific issue that needs to be looked into, no other apps act this way. Otherwise it is a solid fun game for music lovers.
Grrr So frustrating First of all I tapped the tiles and it didn't work then ads pop up and make you loose I will not uninstall the app but plz FIX
Bad Bad

Downgraded It looks pretty but I'm getting tired of it not initializing, forcing me to reinstall it to get it going again. Closing the app andor cleaning the cache doesn't work. I'll have to consider another app.
I love the game But these advertisements are making me hate it. There's also a glitch where if I rotate my phone while on the you won screen, it makes me play the level over again.

The worst app ever.  Uninstalling it.
Too much info  not worth the money Do not consider this app unless you're an aviator or a sailor.

Insure member who can't access app I've been a Discovery Insure member for months, yet the app doesn't allow me access when I enter my ID number.
Gayyyy Lame
Waste of time I'm deleting this game.... Please don't waste time in this game..... The computer decides the winner and not our game
What happened to the weekly and monthly prices What happened to the weekly and monthly prices After new update doesn't show only daily rate Will go back to 5 stars when fixed 
It's wrong what happened Your a douche in this game because when I tried to put a show you said Sorry, your not popular enough to fill this show. I got angry your a dick.

Hhh Fuck u
Useless Wants me to purchase everything, way to expensive useless game
Horrible This game is a joke. You can't buy vowels. There is no instructions. You just keep playing the same one over and over if you don't guess it right. Waste of space.
Collateral wastage ov time It doesnt even deserve a single star...was it created in the early 90z...it sucks,i feel horrible for the time i spent downloading it and my data...just meh
Can't login I can login using a browser but not the app with the same credentials. It tells me my Password is wrong when it clearly is not.
I'm not installing this app reading the valuable reviews... the reviews from previous users help us a lot...thanks to all reviewers... this talk as simple as that I'm not installing this app reading the valuable reviews...
TOO MANY ADS Its an okay game but there are way too many ads
LAG LAG LAG LAG this game is soooooo laggy and sooooo awesome i love playing it but if the lags there it crashes. please fix this bug
New update sucks I hate the new update Solo game only has 5 cards in the stockpile. Want it back to 30 and to be able to have scores Games go too fast
Quit adding crap Getting tired of being forced to wait while discover and live loads I don't want those features. I just want the simple snapchat back, and no better rating until then
Wow so Fanny me alon before chake this program
Too small to see options at end of game Once the game is finish, the three tabs in center of window are very miniature, can't see them, please fix. I am using Samsung S6 edge 5.0.2 OS.
Really.. Its sad that one of my favorite games on my old motorola atrix is now unusable on my new galaxy note 2 because of how slow it runs and the lag issues.
Frustrating Good game, spoilt by TINY fonts, makes being a severely partially sighted gamer impossible on this game, a small oversight pardon the pun, but beyond annoying. Fixoffer font size option and ill rate 5
Ridiculously complicated for a 2 year old.
No point....
  .    .  .fuckyou

Match fixing game You can fix the match easily by inviting friends.

WTH Update was terrible Bad update. This game was great now its just trash. All my players went down hill I actually paid money for them. You can barely hit the ball now its just terrible now. Can you please fix or compensate me for wasting my money.

Stopped running Installed recently and it does not work, problem with the latest update. Loads and only get a black screen. Fix and will give it higher rating.
It can be better with more features Where are the blockers The colors of following and not following are similar.
Never works, horrible update The app was already not calling out a lot of the time before the update and ever since the update the app is incredibly slow and next to never puts the calls through. No point of an app to call if you can't make calls...
Remove the ad.. We paid for it.. Ad on the paid app Is a big NO NO..
Crashes I can't play longer or pass 2 stages because the game mostly crashes when I clear the first or second stage. I'm using Samsung Galaxy Pocket

I make 2 star because it's my first time, my next if have more experience.
Shocking After watching rating of this app downloaded it but it was not worth according to rating. After securing some of my phone apps by this app they still open without asking any security code.
Mehhhh... I guess it's ok. AT best. However it crashes often, yes cleared the data and rebooted to no avail. Won't allow to correct the calibration, it force closes. Very buggy and I'm stuck with a 10 app that doesn't work.

Kid really enjoyed it but it just stopped working this week.  I uninstalled and reinstalled it and...nothing.  Pretty bad.
Umm It's not real, just a fake. But it supposed to be a joke.
Gem purcahses I would trade my soul and one corn chip to the devil for two things getting the gems I'm supposed to get after I complete an offer and for less of a need to online race.
Good game but Ads have become very annoying as they keep launching the Google Play Store in the middle of the game quite often. Very intrusive and crosses the line. Will be uninstalling.
Poorly worded questions Many questions have ambiguous meaning or multiple answers which would be correct. It's worth playing for free but don't buy.
not good bought this and can't play want money back.
Bad Very horrible . Don' t download
Amazing game with awfull controls This game is a good game, but the controls on tablet make it impossible to play.... The left stick is not responding correctly an precise moves just get impossible...

No good When i was playing Deal or no Deal it said it stopped and then i went to play on it again it took my tokens and i didn't even let me play the rest of it. But how ever i am going to keep this game
Good I liked it very much
Graphical error cannot even see compass
something is wrong Something does not work with the algorythm for dice rolling. It does not roll neither hard ways nor any of the Horn bets 2, 3, 11, 12. I get only 4,  5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 the easy way. How am I supposed to 'train' with this
Lag Fix fken delay even im stick to the router still fken delay
Hated it Possibly one of the worst games I've ever played, goalies don't move, faceoffs are terrible, and it's almost impossible to get the ball once you've lost it.

Sucks Cant turn my holiday decoder on or off anymore. Why did you have to go and change something that worked to total crap
Awesome game Love the game, great way to kill a lot of down time. Its be cool if there was a speed up game time button, and then if we could have a bigger play space. But still 5 stars all the way.
The UI has not changed for years, no one really goes out of their way to contact each other and limiting everything with a points system is a terrible business model.
Eh I dont like this game right now because it just logs me out. Please update and I'll give you 5 stars
It's a rili bad app All the voice changes are all typically the same sound, super boring... an Arnie Shwats mimic or a james bond and other iconic sounds would hv bin gr8 nt a muffled voice frm a fan come do btter
Cricket notification keeps turning on Needed a replacement for Boat Browser.  This is not it.  I remember using UC years ago  it wasn't this bloated and annoying.  I didn't want to go past the home page.  Sorry,  uninstalled.
No Man y'all need help like a mother................... better be lucky it's not number because I would have picked 0
Bard's Tale Can not save my game without it becoming corrupted. I really liked the game on the original Nintendo. I was hoping to get an updated version for my tablet.
There's no way to turn and seems like the truck is slow and there's no selection of different model trucks to choose from or unlock
Couldn't get thru a game. The bubbles are very slow to pop and the flashing literally made me nautious.
Bakwas This app has not given me any free nuggets ... Have maximized my phone memory n installed app n not gain..... I think u should close p .... Cheats
DUMB GAME Every time I go on the game it resets. I'm deleting this game. It is point less to make a game that resets when you do a lot of work on it. I WANT MY MONEY BACK
You have to be kidding me I cannot compare few currencies by my choice  That is  ridiculous limitation for such an app.
Dry .... and boring, boring, boring, boring, boring Graphics look like they belong on a  breakfast cereal packet. Instead try Race of nations Through the ages, vastly better game for free.
So bad game don't download please
Love the game, hate the bullshit Slow load times, wimpy interface, LOSES MY SAVES, would give 4 stars if my game progress didn't vanish, 5 stars if they speed it up a bit

Stupid game I hate this game like stupid like it's author

Multiplayer issues Even though im clearly connected to wifi it will not let me connect to multiplayer
4 pics 1 word It seems like if a person gets a little bit stuck the game wants that person to buy a letter otherwise it will not give a person the chance to guess or to think. I might uninstall it tomorrow and give the game a minus one star.
Great game, but Doesn't work on Nexus 7 running Lollipop 5.0.1. Game just crashes. EA please fix.
Good
Updates should improve performance I think it is great to update this app to work better for the 7 of Android users on version 5. but should the other 93 be penalized with reduced performance.
I love the game but..... The game keeps on crashing I haven't even played one game yet. I am very upset
Latest update caused the game to start with a black screen.  Sound and music  Yes, but no image at all.  Fix the bug please and this applies to Frontier as well
TOO MUCH MONEY I cant afford anything It takes so long to buy power plant and wind its my 1st day playing and 3 houses have already been abandoned Plz fix
Not Great Sometimes works.  Does not transfer all files.  Sometimes transfers a file name with no data.  Simple to use.  But will look for something more efficient.
Worst service Messages don't get sent, no response from CS, always connecting yet never connecting. There's better out there, not using this anymore

It is a ok game but you need to do more
Smartone 
Needs work Please fix the visual problems. Portions of my screen aren't visible because another part of the menu is blocking it. The buttons for your inventory are under the image not on it. Needs work. Samsung Galaxy Tab A 9.7
App functionality ok but very very poor service Took me 8 calls ,30 rupees on phone bill to get a sorry from their side...and yea an added no taxi available after putting and cancelling 4 drivers as a gift too...
It won't work since I don't know if you have to set it up or what
Not good. Wish you can just automatically get the lazor light instead of paying coins
Liked it until... Was on level 20 something, didnt get all the popcycles needed and the message said The penguins are POed Isnt this also a kid game That was way uncool... DELETING FOR THIS REASON
Sync issue Its a good 5 secs out of sync video to sound
It doesn't do any more than the free version. I tried to pay categories choosing medical science and it the our questions from every category but medical science.
Good, but... I can't lay bets. If that was fixed, I'd cheerfully increase my score. As of now, a vital part of the game is missing.
...     ...    .    
I hate it  its so so slow and it to fast and I die so much don't it
Freezes  Unplayable The game freezes every few rounds, making it unplayable. Great game otherwise. Wish it worked 
Android Platform Game Error After the latest update the Game hangs a lot and takes a lot of time to start the match or in purchasing anything..
Not much of a challenge. Strange game this.
Ads are too much Sorry I had to remove all angry birds from all my devices as they are nothing but malware now.
First thing, the remote isn't working... And secondly the app continuously keeps on showing ads....

Terrible Worst pay outs of any slot machine game I have played. Leveling is extremely slow as well. Find another way to waste your time.
Don't update Now won't load.. kept getting kicked out if the draft. Very frustrating.  Now can't even see my team. Now I try to loGin it says I have no teams.
Pretty fun but........ I always either win or lose on certain levels. It's kinda annoying. If I set it on an easy level, I always win, and if its on a hard level, I always lose. It's fun to play with a human partner though.
Cant find me saved avitar amywere on mu albums.. Sorry guys not for me.. but if you can fix the issue that would be kawaaiii

Task force When you join a task force so you can hit opponents with your colleagues it won't let you attack together at the same time...you attack solo. Don't join a task force.
Download error, no refund It downloads the game twice and then says error downloading 963
Its ok Not many things to do... definatly not worth the money DONT BUY THIS
Very easy. Why can not we choose hard level Please make it harder. Need more improvements on graphics.
This app is anauthorized in you android device I've been having that error. I hope this game has a list of device of it's compatibility. I need my money back
Terrible. Poorly planned. Poorly designed. Complete ripoff. Spawn and die. Useless controls. Instant deaths. Inability to land and fight. Impotent attacks. Not worth spending the time to even learn to play  worthless game
Crashes Paid for this game and it crashes.... why oh why
Agressive popups Pops up adds during gameplay not in between games like usual. Clicking 'X' merely opens an internet tab for the adds used, rather than closing the add screen phishing
This is the worst game I have ever played every time I go init I press the app  and I go in but it kicks me out.
UI is outdated
Highly disappointed in this Artifex Mundi game. Paid for the full game since I usually love their games but this was no where near the level of many of their other games. 4.99 is too much money for this quickly put together game.
I can't even play the game I purchased the game this past weekend and I haven't been able to play it since. The game errors out and does not load. Why have this in the play store when it's a piece of crap
Fitur tidak friendly Gak ada kotak Search di halaman depan daftar komik drag sanasini nyari komik juga Go to page ketika membaca mesti ngulang dr halaman 1 konyol..
Doesn't do anything please fix this and make a new one please ok I don't want to be rude
Dislike it Good RPG with Google Play Game Features and great presentation, but too expensive 5 for an Android game is ludicrous, no Google Cloud Sync, and no immersive full screen on KitKat.
Doesn't recognize words Several words are not recognized. Lots of suggested words aren't in the dictionary.  Good start, but needs a better lexicographer. New version still has a very limited vocabulary.
Keep Crushing After new update,im able to play for frw hours then keep crushing..is it ur server problem or my connection..other games dont have any problem..fix please..tq
Download issue Trying to reload the app and it is telling me that I don't sufficient storage. Help I've deleted apps and I'm still having issues
NAGWARE Floods the phone with useless, annoying ads and constantly begs you to upgrade to an adfree version. Very annoying. Not worth the download.
Uggh I played every level and bought every upgrade to everything possible on this game loved it so much but needs WAY more levels  wasted my money ...
Used to be the best There was a score card widget and you can scroll from one news to the next. Now No score cards. You have to leave the news before accessing the next one. Some of the new on the website is not even on the app. Fix this please

Interrupting Always Jamed When I play... Even my Line is strong... please Fix it...Make it run Smoothly... thanks...
Virtual piano This app has too many bugs. I would not reccomend this app
Not all that I purchased the game for my 5 year old. Its far to advanced for her. She gets frustrated every time she losses and they don't have an option to change the game level to easy. So I guess I just wasted my money.
Worthless I am using it from last 4 years, but still unmarried p

Really awesome It's a good game but I can't seem to sign into my account and there's no recover password option
Broken I was enjoying the game, but after the last patch it's become essentially unplayable.  Clothing no longer appears on the avatar, the runway game has become a blind guessing game, and dates make the game crash.

Still doesn't work It's been three separate updates and the app still doesn't open. This is happening to many people and they need to fix whatever they did to break their app.
Boring One of the worst games I have ever played and I honestly feel robbed of my cash
Paid for the app Paid for the app now buy addons for it these games are costing more than platform games when your all said an down.  Better off buying a 500 dollar PS4 an 65 dollar game it be cheaper.

Misleading app You could not open this app it could not validate it self and kept closing.  Paid for it and would like a refund as it did not work . Brought it as a xmas present for my son

To improve villo integration in brussels Not bad, unfortunately villo bikes are not yet well integrated in Brussels. For instance my villo station mile max lycee is not there.

Annoying ads Plays an annoying video ad, which uses your data plan, every time you use the app. This is the most intrusive advertising I've ever seen in an app. Uninstalling. Doesn't even deserve 1 star.
SUCKS DO NOT DOWNLOAD GAME CRASHES I WANT REFUND
Too many ads The amount of ads that pop up while they're drawing in less than 5 minutes is stupid. Why not have one ad each time the app is opened instead of having them pop up while they're playing Bad design. Defeats the purpose.

Fun game but... I keep buying thing like fionna and cake, and a few gems but they never showed up, it's fun but if things don't work when I want to get them and go to use them what's the point If you could fix that, that'd be great.

Ripoff.. You must earn or buy the ability to unlock races beyond the second race at 1.96 each. This is a ripoff, considering how foolishly difficult it is to unlock with stars...
Waste of money Only 3 or 4 games repeated over and over, and don't get any more difficult. Should be free.
Using a high spec genuine dongle and this app lights my dash up like a Christmas tree. Throws up all sorts of dash light issues as well as lowering suspension and gearbox lock out from low ratio etc. Not advisable for Land Rover canbus systems

Crashes more than a crash test dummy This app is basically unusable. Keeps telling me I have no connection when I know perfectly well my connection is good.
Controls really bad. Can get chemical plant stage 2. This really should have never been ported. The screen is inadequate to control this game that needs precision. A feature that would be nice to add would be a level select option.

Good game and all however... I love the game and all but there is just one problem. The game is saying it's under maintenance for 2 hours.  It has been much longer then 2 hours. Fix this please and get 5 stars.
Buggy Mark is visible during first session. After closing out the game for a day in my case. The mark is not visible. While that adds a level of challenge it is more frustrating than fun.
Force close all the time Lots of problems, force close, error in texts, hang in the middle of the game. Please fix those Too bad, this is one of the greatest ff series, and doesnt cheap either for the price
Doesn't work on lollipop platform
New design Each tilecategory should be moveable to the users choice. I'll go up to 5 stars if that happened

Very new to this Why isn't the main map, when you're waiting for an alert, available in landscape You do understand that windshield holders are for landscape mode, right
Not impressed Pop up ads every few seconds. Also didn't like that you can't just skip and go back later instead it uses your points and doesn't tell you the answer before moving on. Worth a look but I won't be keeping it.
Too much delay It's impossible to play this game using this app.  The delay is awful.  So disappointed.
Way more adds than the average I get adds but this is nuts. Can't even enjoy the game without a 30 second video after each turn
Back up the camera, Jesus. I played awhile ago and the camera was so much better. now it's too close and not setting to back it up.

Don't waste your time. Read the reviews and thought it couldn't be that bad. Boy was I wrong. Not only was it a waste of time looking at it but pop up ads everywhere I mean all over the place. Worst bloat app ever

Radio streaming doesn't work Well it does for two seconds and then turns off hard to read more than two stars when the main reason I have this app is to listen to it. Though the coverage I have heard it is good. Please fix streaming
Great but... The song ends around halfway in the time mode. Please fix it. And also make the score mode slower.
The game itself was fun, but ads get worse every day, the game crashes all the time, and now the game will not run until you go to ad website. Really Don't use it, even free so not worth it.

Lay bets So when are you adding lay bets..there are other craps games that have it already
Samsung Galaxy S4 Yeah, thanks for making almost everything cool in the customization section cost gold coins. That's one hell of a way to ruin a perfectly good game that deserves 5 stars. You get only one, because you are greedy AF.

Fake way of making money  U make money with fraudulently  making us pay and we don't get anything  This is serious...pls revert else I will sue u guys in court...
Sudden reboot When i try to integrate update into system, move to system, move to user. Xperia M last stock firmware
Really wish i could play Game will get stuck on loading screen and im trying to figure out if it is because i have a galaxy 3 phone and its unable to support the game or somethin.
A potentially good game bogged down many glarring issues PROS Great graphics  controls are intuitive for a touch screen  CONS A revive system which dates back to the NES era and it's outdated now  combat is too easy and is not deep
Froze my phone This didn't do much more than the free version for me. It froze my phone at 22 during the scan. No help 
They got money from me and not once did I get the bouns on the game they got it set up to take your money DON'T SPEND YOUR TIME OR MONEY Frankinstine game
Very poor Very poor I thought that u got to race your own horse but u only get to bet on random horses
Sudoku Premium Love it, but seems as though game moody.  Will stop and even go back to home screen. Repeatedly click theresume game ,  it just goes faster and then quits.  Sad to happen to such an enjoyable app.
Too few levels then pay to play on, I think not.
Doesn't refresh the feed I paid money for this and it doesn't work. Before I used official free twitter app, it was ugly and slow, but it did perform its main function to show you new tweets. This app doesn't do that and therefore is useless.
Reduced my level to beginner again for no known reason
Hate it
Money grab I bought 5 worth of gems and didn't receive them, such a scam
Worked fine but after only 3 months traffic not working even though  I subscribed for a year and paid 40 odd pounds ....
Hey it doesn't work anymore... Won't open anymore .
Not all notes working on Sony please fix
Everytime I click the play button it send me right back to my home screen

Keeps crashing I used to love this app, but now it keeps crashing. Uninstall and reinstall did not work. Having to delete it once again. Was hoping it would be fixed now after many months...
It's not free Should at least get one free a year
Every time it updates it changes my saved collection. Please fix.
Rubbish I couldn't lift the lid of the snow cone for ten minute's and when I did lift the lid the ice pack wouldn't go in so don't download it.
Rubish
Wrong tone Plz give the right tone on the key plz, if u do ill give u 5 stars
Confusing Can't get it to push tweets to my sw3 smartwatch.
Doesn't see Win 7 media Great idea. But this thing doesn't see my media. My Windows 7 media PC has a second hard drive for videos that is also the only point set as the video library. This app doesn't see the video library at all.
Lose lose If you bet pass line and come you will see nothing but 2,3,12,and a lot of 7's. If you bet the don't side you will see a lot of points being made.

Angry I payed And I can not download it again after buying a new phone.... keeps appearing an unknown error  though I purchased legal with prepayed cash Please fix that issue or I want my money back
Crap This game is a waste of time it keeps freezing get feed up with it reloading. It's as much use as a chocolate fire guard.  Don't waste your money.  It has a lot of improvement to be done  for it to be a good game.
Can't even log in to the app
It sucked Every time I got to move  I kept turning in circles
Good sim but money hungry Ok now, special mission next to impossible without buying the special aircraft...overall good game but cant seem to complete that one mission

game It shows a lors if advertisement and very skiw un my apple I phone 6plus si tiu dint have ti diwnload it
Stop bothering This is for keeping on asking to rate the app every time I opened it. There are only 2 options now and later. If you don't want negative feedback then stop bothering people and add the 3rd option never

The app doesn't even work.. It sucks when you load up a bunch of comics for offline use on a long road trip... and then they don't work. The desktop is even worse I can't even sign in to use the desktop app. I wouldn't recommend this app or service.
No any new update since more than year It's a paid game and there is nothing new updates... In real race 3 there are a lot to do and new regular updates when the game is free...
Loading.... App just hangs on the loading screen forever and never actually starts.
Gamepad Gamepad works great on Android TV, but no support for gamepad on tablet. Seems like a quick fix to make this a much better experience on tablet

New update I can't watch them if I try to text them when I send it the image goes out... I also liked when the screen would get bigger. It's not working for me.
Not so good. The App is quick in responds but has this long Sustain of the notes..  This makes it difficult play Your own tunes.
Will not work The game only works if the customer orders pizza, and I can't get a refund. Need help, thanks.
Does not work. Loading spinner. That's all it does. Even on a 4M wifi  connection.
Sucks I can't even play it takes a long time and qr code does not work don't download
Still too buggy This should be an app which you can easily enter your score. Instead it crashes if you have no open rounds. The stats option would be a nice to have but fix the rest first
The worsts Everytime i play with the computer the computer is only winning worst game ever 
Please understand I want to save my games but I always have to start over if I build some thing really cool and I later want to come back to it I can't its not fair but otherwise I lloovvee IIT sooooooo much thanks for understanding.....

Won't let me play It won't let me play as guest and even I created and verified a new account, it always says kid.invalidpassword even if I really entered the correct password many times, It still won't let me sign in
Garbage App is broken Used to work well. Now it recognizes half the addresses I type in and sends me indirect routes. Has even changed the address mid trip on me. Today it wont recognize my location and shows me San Francisco. I live in Ohio.

Good
